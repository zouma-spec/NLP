A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6303257348,darragh o'donoghue,"[120, 125]", To Yuma is a stark monochrome Western that has been praised for its suspense and high moral tone  Van Heflin in a darker variant on his role in Shane plays a character who picks up where most Westerns leave off  The genre is usually concerned with taming wild loners or men with pasts rewarding them with the joys of civilisation  Heflin has seen what civilisation really means  He lives on a droughtdry farm with a wife and two children he often fails to feed  The grind of fruitless labour has worn them all down and Heflins identity as a man having been once the greatest shot in these parts is now undermined by humiliation in front of his family by outlaws stealing his cattle and horses or forced to beg money from indifferent acquaintances  His wife cant understand that his inability to be a man is the result of the civilisation she representsWhats a poor honest farmer to do when he sees murderers and thieves throwing money around drinking their fill bedding beautiful strangers and generally living the whoopingitup life  Glenn Ford is the notcompletelyirredeemable leader of a gang of devoted sadists so feared throughout the region that no lawman dares touch him  Such men are usually let down by their sexual desire and when he leaves his gang to schmooze a barmaid he is captured by the locals  Knowing that they will be no match for the manpower or ruthlessness of the gang when they return to rescue Ford the sheriff plans a decoy which will need two foolishly brave men to take the bandit to the train station at Contention City  The initally reluctant Heflin accepts the job when a farmsaving reward of  is offeredIn many ways Yuma works against the conventions of the Western as it seeks like the hero to avoid action and the inevitable climactic shootout for as long as possible  The films centrepiece is a lengthy stagy sequence in a hotel room in which Heflin holds Ford prisoner  potential ponderousness is offset by the terrific acting of the two aging actors one goading and testing the other tempting with crooked offers that are all too tempting the other struggling manfully to resist  At first Heflins taking the job is strictly economical  he needs the money  Then it becomes ethical a stand against socially disruptive forces threatening the community  It is also a test of the masculinity that has long been buried by family duties  Finally it is an existential struggle with Ford as the man Heflin could easily become and perhaps once was and his men as the instruments of inexorable Fate the farmer must face and outwit on his own stripped of support just as Man must eventually face DeathThe films miseenscene is suitably austere the blackandwhite cinematography emphasising sharp contrasts the alienating outlines of buildings and landscapes and the vulnerable men and women who walk through them  sometimes watching Yuma is like leafing slowly through an album of stark th century photographs taken of the West  The city in which the film is mostly played out initially seems like a ghost town and a surreal funeral sequence interrupting or accentuating the tension gives a quality of dream  Delmer Daves direction is not selfeffacing  every shot is meticulously often heavily composed character patterns structured in frames creating a sense of constriction and claustrophobia that serves to turn the plots screws  What saves the film from being just another superfical High Noon allegory is the sudden bursts of violence rupturing the tense silence and the ultimate refusal to wholeheartedly embrace doomandgloom existentialism,4,From a time when men had to prove they were men.,1022025600,"05 22, 2002",stark monochrome suspense high moral tone darker

A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B00005JLR8,Mark,"[4, 4]",Many reviewers on this site have said that they would want to see a film that focuses on the hardships and extremes that immigrants face when coming to the United States  To this I respond Weve seen that hundreds of times in films  The same goes for sports films  Weve seen the movie Glory Road in other films like Coach Carter Remember the Titans and Hoosiers  They are exactly the same movie with a different team  Thats not to say that these films arent decent sports flicks but the film industry needs to take a step back when making a film that has the potential to be just like every other film in its genreThat being said that is exactly what Jim Sheridan does with In America  The story is so original and the acting makes this film a glorious triumph  The basic story follows a family of Irish immigrants who come to America with the same notion that all immigrants have to attain the American Dream  But as they all sooner or later find out the American Dream is an ideology that  of people never attain  They have trouble finding a place to stay and end up with an apartment at the top of a run down building with many of its residents being junkies  The father Johnny Paddy Considine is a struggling actor who hasnt been able to get a part since the death of his son Frankie who fell down the stairs  The mother Sarah Samantha Morton takes a job at an ice cream parlor to earn the rent money  The oldest daughter Christy Sarah Bolger is probably one of the smarter people in the film and Sarah Bolger gives a flawless performance for such a young girl  She is the stereotype of the oldest child who is forced to grow up too soon  Her younger sister Ariel played by Sarah Bolgers younger sister Emma is the typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions about everythingThere are some really touching scenes throughout the course of the film one especially comes to mind where the father almost squanders away all of the familys money trying to win an ET doll for the youngest daughter  There are essentially three miracles in the film and Christy who is also the narrator relates these three events to a set of three wishes that her brother Frankie told her about before he died  The other great scenes in the film involve the family and their relationship to the man on one of the floors below  When they first arrive in the house Christy calls him the man who screams  This mans name is Mateo played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou and he is a brilliant artist with quite a bit of emotional problems  He is sort of the figure of morality in the film often giving out endless amounts of advice  Mateo has some sort of disease we can only expect that it is probably a venerial disease and he gets sick throughout the movieIn America features one of the best ensembles I have ever seen  Every actor is perfect in every scene  Djimon Hounsou and Paddy Considine give the best performances in the entire film and Jim Sheridan wrote and directed every gorgeous shot of the film  While I do agree with one other reviewer about how Christy has a modern camera in a story set in the eighties stupid facts like these should not detract from the overall message of the film  The overall message then is not just about how immigrants face hardships when they come to America we already know that from previous films andor experiences  The film has such a deeper message relating not just to immigrants but to every person who watches this film  I really do not want to give the message away but rather I will leave it up to you to go rent or buy this treasure of a film  This is truly one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever seen,5,One of the Best Movies I've Seen In a Long

werewolf dressed in a suitwho comes to wake his master out of his coffinyou know whoThey start talking about a patient in a local sanatoriumWe switch to the hospital and a doctor there is commenting to a Lady Ainsleyhis assistantabout their patients anemiaThe patient is left with an attendant and as the vampire cannot gain access to the patienthe attacks the doctors young girl NikkiThe doctor stays up at night reading a manuscript on vampires by one Dr Teslathe vampire himself and written some  years beforeThe next day the patient is found dead and the doctor then notices two puncture marks on the neck and surmises it is vampiric in natureThe doctor also finds two such marks on his daughter who they cannot readily awakenHe saves her by giving her a blood transfusionThe doctoraccompanied by Ainsleyfinds the vampires coffin and drives a stake into its heartAt the same time his werewolf assistant arrives and the spell put on him by the vampire is taken awayand he returns to be being humanAlmost  years pass and Ainsley is talking to the head of Scotland yard about just the same occurrences of  years beforeand he tells her if he can find the body of the person they stakedshe may be liable for charges of murderIn the meantime Ainsley has rehabilitated the werewolfcalled Andreaswho works relentlessly for the now older AinsleyThis is London in WWand a German bombing dislodges the very coffin containing the body of the staked vampireTwo men come by to reinter the corpses and one of themnoticing the stake in the heartmistakes it for some shrapnel and pulls it out before they bury itThis of course has the unintended consequence of raising the vampire from the dead once moreBack at the Ainsley houseAinsley tells Andreas to go to meet a Dr Bruckner at the

A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6304240554,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]",Few filmmakers now how to do a zombie movie and get it right I hate to think what the zombie movie genre would be without George Romero  s Night of the Living Dead is still the archetype of zombie films in my opinion featuring a virtually perfect ending  s followup Dawn of the Dead is another true classic featuring scenes so shocking that absolutely no one under  could be admitted to theaters to see it  By todays standards the film is hardly shocking at all but Romeros up close and personal look at a nihilistic world simply crawling with the undead is the kind of movie that makes horror lovers stand up and cheer  The level of violence in this film is delightfully high sure it all looks pretty fake now but in its day Dawn of the Dead helped lay the groundwork for later gorefests full of blood and gutsI dont as a general rule care for zombies or zombie movies  Zombies are ugly and stupid  they basically just wander around in a clumsy manner only reacting to the nearness of human life fresh for the taking and eating  Thats about all they do here as well but at least they turn out in huge numbers for this George Romero classic  We dont know what started the trouble as the movie opens the world is already in a heap of a mess  There are cops and soldiers killing zombies by the dozens but its obviously just a few bloods drops in the proverbial bucketTV news coverage features experts saying how bad everything is and how we should have taken action sooner demanding people leave their selfbarricaded homes and come together in a dwindling number of central locations  Roger DeMarco Scott H Reiniger flies his girlfriend Francine Gaylen Ross and friend Stephen Andrews David Emge out of town in a helicopter  Stephens sharpshooting buddy Peter Washington Ken Foree also comes along for the ride  Low on gas and unsure of what they should do the gang lands on the roof of a large shopping mall and eventually decides to hole up there for a while  Isolating themselves upstairs our wouldbe survivors then begin making forays inside the mall for necessary supplies  The place is crawling with pastyfaced zombies so they put together a plan that will or so they hope keep additional zombies from gaining access to the site once that is done its just a matter of killing all of the zombies already stumbling around inside  Of course as we all know people are stupid so this prolonged stay inside the mall faces its share of challenges and dangers  Along the way countless numbers of zombies are shot bludgeoned and taken out with whatever deadly instruments one happens to find handy  Never fear there is some zombie feeding as well although once again I have to express my disappointment that no brains were ever eaten zombies are supposed to eat brains  thats my personal zombie philosophy  One question hovers near the front of your mind throughout this film how will it end  The world has basically come to an end making for some long odds for our heroes survival  While the ending is not completely satisfying I do believe it makes for a right and fitting conclusion to this most extraordinary of horror classicsLet me speak to the violence portrayed here  However shocking it was upon the movies release it really isnt shocking at all in this day and age the quantity of violence though still impresses  Plenty of zombies fall over the course of these two hours plus but few of the quotdeathsquot are what I would call gory  In many cases a zombie takes a shot between the eyes and falls down in some cases there is blood especially when zombies get a chance to do a little feeding but you certainly wont see anybody lying in a pool of blood  In many cases a zombie gets taken out with no blood at all  certainly the amount of gore you would expect from shotgun blasts to the head just doesnt exist here  The blood I might also mention doesnt even look like blood  unless red corpuscles changed to orange corpuscles without anyone telling meIn the end it comes down to this Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie films ever made  more than that its one of the best horror films ever made  It cemented George Romeros name in the hallowed shrines of horror it crossed the Rubicon or perhaps I should say the river Styx and dared to give viewers the quantity of senseless violence so many of us crave  There is also a sociological slant to the movie that many feel compelled to comment on I personally think its something of a stretch to classify four desperate wouldbe survivors as some type of bourgeoisie enjoying the luxury the shopping mall affords them while the nameless hordes of plebeian zombies mill around aimlessly  However you want to interpret it Dawn of the Dead is horror at its very best up close and in your face,5,Arguably the best zombie movie ever made,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",Few now do zombie movie get right think zombie movie genre be still

seaside home and a friend Angie who her son  loves  This is a woman who you quickly feel has it all  Just as quickly  something goes terribly wrong  Her husband Nick Bruce Greenwood  surprises Liz by showing her a large sailboat and suggests that they take  it out for a spin before he buys it for her  We next see Liz happy at the  helm of this boat and all seems idyllicWhat happens next is not so  idyllic  Liz who has been drinking wakes up to find her robe the bed  the floor and just about anywhere you can look covered with blood  There  are blood trails bloody handprints bloody footprints leading out of the  cabin up the stairs and over the side of the boat now shrouded in fog  Liz looks down at the deck sees a bloody knife and makes her first  apparent mistake she picks it up  Just as she does so a Coast Guard  cutter pulls up and compels her to put the knife downA few scenes  later with no sign of Nicks body Liz finds herself under arrest and also  finds a healthy dose of evidence that she did the deed  Without much ado  Liz is convicted and sent to prison She asks her friend Angie Annabeth  Gish to adopt Matty because she knows Matty loves Angie  This  accomplished Liz sees Angie and Matty for a visit or two when suddenly  Angie stops bringing Matty to the prison  When Liz calls Angie she finds  the number disconnectedSo far so good  However now the contrivances  kick in  Without so much as a disguised voice Liz calls the school  district where Angie works pretending to be Angie verifying the address of  quotherquot severance checks  From this call Liz discovers Angie has  moved to San Francisco  So Liz calls Angie answers a heated discussion  follows  Finally Liz gets to speak to Matty  While talking the  apartment door open and who walks in but Nick presumed dead  Matty says  quotDaddyquot and suddenly Liz realizes shes been set  upApparently she tells all of this to two inmates who have taken Liz  under their wing even though theres no compelling reason for them to do  so  Roma Maffia and Davenia McFadden play the inmates respectively  Margaret Skolowski and Evelyn Lake  Skolowski a convicted murderer who  happened to be an attorney tells Liz that she can actually kill her  husband since shes already been convicted of murdering him anyway a  provision of the Constitutions Fifth AmendmentNow for those of you  whove read my earlier review of The Negotiator some of what follows may  sound familiar  All of this action to this point has taken place in the  span of a halfhour notice nowhere have I mentioned the character played  by Tommy Lee Jones  That character is Travis Lehman her parole officer  who is portrayed as a no nonsense guy who doesnt give second  chancesWhat follows from here to the end is a film I couldnt help  compare with s The Fugitive  Lehman pursues Liz across Washington  State Colorado and New Orleans as she herself follows the trail of her  missing son and the husband who framed herThis film had the potential  to be a great thriller and one reason it got even two stars was for a  marvelous Hitchcockian sequence in a New Orleans cemetary that was actually  pulled off by director Bruce Beresford  The climatic scene was  nearperfect as well  What falters is the overly contrived script by David  Weisberg and Douglas S Cook who were responsible for The Rock where they  did a much better job  Weisberg and Cook sets up situations and then dont  follow their own rules  So instead of a taut thriller where you wonder  how our heroine is going to accomplish her tasks the whole thing comes off  as kind of lethargicJones gives a journeyman performance as Lehman the  parole officer who comes to realize that hes pursuing an innocent woman  Judd is excellent and does everything thats asked of her although at  times she seemed a bit subdued  Bruce Greenwood imbued Nick with a kind  of charm you could almost love if you didnt know what hes done to his  wifeI love mysteries I wanted to highly recommend this film but in  the end I cant  Double Jeopardy may be an OK way to spend a rainy  afternoon to view at a discount movie house or to rival a TVmovie but  as a topnotch thriller it doesnt make the

A1N8ST7FQO4S3K,B004BDOEZO,"Leif A. Ostgard ""ostgard""","[3, 10]",One thing that baffles me is how someone who was never a fan of the original cartoon and an almost  year old producer are somehow qualified to revamp a franchise and cater it to the same kidsnow adults that will wonder if they ever watched the series researched the series or have a clue as to why kids liked it in the first place  Somehow I cant find the answer and that has been the biggest problem with this franchise  Besides Prime nothing is relatable to the original series to tie these same adults to it in a manner that will have longevity  Basically they got it wrong when sometimes people get it right and satisfy the youth locked into the  something adult much like some goofoff movie like Fanboys or recently Iron Man  Still all nostalgia aside even as a casual fan the last two movie totally sucked  The storys were lame and the dialogue was horrible and almost embarrassing I would never tell someone to watch it out of feeling shame when they thought it suckedI walked into this movie expecting it to be worse as usually the middle act of a trilogy is the best and thus I had no inclination that this could be drug out of the gutter  I was surprised  The movie still suffers from the usual nonsense however  Steven Spielberg has this penchant for always adding wise cracking Gremlin style characters to his movies and they are in abundance here  Laserbeak looks like a robotic reject puppet part from the movie The Dark Crystal without the puppet cast and has the most annoying cliche s sultress cartoon voice  Imagine a evil female villian from any Disney film and there you go  These characters use social dialogue which will only date a film years past and are annoying in present day as it is adding horrible top  music doesnt help either  How can I get into a movie with that girlie guy from American Idol singing in the background its impossible  The script is a little better this time around but for a movie targeted at kids and to sell kids toys and other stuff its laced with adult themes and slander  I would not take a child to this movie under  maybe   When gremlin mini robot says this is a cluster at which time the scene changes everyone knows what they are implying  So whats the point of that  To be clever  This movie is dumbed down like a comedy but uses adult themes like a drama but has hardcore action scenes like a R action movie autobots getting their heads blown off execution style  Who is this catered too  Kids  Adults  Again I am lost  The action scenes were well done way better than the previous films inwhich the director is so impressed with the CGI that they slow it down and ram it down your throats while ignoring the reason they are in the scene to begin with  I once knew someone that said they thought it was awesome because the affects were so neat  Thats a sad thing to say about a movie  This time they ace all the closeups of the gears and constant motion and use longer shots and more character driven scenes such as between Bumblebee and that kid who isnt called Spike  There are some throwbacks in this film unlike the others that avoided them  Megatron is still nothing like the character people rememeber  They debut Shockwave but give no explaination of where he came from however he is at least similar to the origianl  They break out a new Prime using Leonard Nimoy who voiced Galvatron in the animated cult classic  He is moreless Ronimus Prime gone bad  The movie imploys the storyline losely of the episode The Ultimate Doom from the  season  Bringing Cybertron to earth  Cybertron by the way is a desolate shell of a planet with no lifewhy bring it to Earth via a space bridge is never explained  Another thing never explained is how this kid picks up hot chicks like his love interest  That is more unbelievable that anything in the movie,2,"Not as bad as the previous, but not all that great",1309478400,"07 1, 2011",thing someone never fan original cartoon almost year

supporting role and instead the lead is taken over by a slippery scoundrel a thief and knifethrower named Cuchillo  This was actually somewhat jarring at first but as the film progressed I began to appreciate its differences  Like most of its kind the plot of Run Man Run is too convoluted to accurately summarize in only a few words  as a hint Ill just say there is a lot of gold which is meant to supply Mexican revolutionaries and several different parties dying to get at it  Cuchillo hears the location of the gold from the lips of a dying man and from there on its Run Cuchillo run as gunslingers bandits French operatives and even the Salvation Army chase after him ready to pry the gold from his cold dead hands if need beThis film is a pleasant surprise  almost everyone involved hits a high note especially Milian and his devoted ruthless intended Dolores Chelo Alonso is hot hot hot  The product description touts John Irelands performance and I agree that he chews up the scenery  for the entire five minutes or so that hes in the film  The others range from fair to good with bandit leader Riza prolific character actor Nello Pazzafini enjoyable in a minor role  Donald OBrien as the former sheriff and revolutionary Cassidynot so much  At any rate Run Man Run conforms to these films habits of mixing and matching surprising and offbeat elements  sometimes forcing a belly laugh from me when I wasnt expecting it  which is part of their charm  In fact Run is more of a comedyadventure  but not in the slapstick mode of the Trinity films as its mixed together with several violent and graphic scenes of the grim Mexican experience during the revolution  The first five minutes of Run illustrates what Im talking about  I dont want to spoil it but I get a chuckle thinking about it even now  Gallows humor I think is appropriate to describe itIn short I think its safe to say that if Italian Westerns havent impressed you in the past then you shouldnt expect much different from this one  But those who do will find an alternate take on the genre or at least told from a different point of view sort of if Tuco had been the primary viewpoint in The Good The Bad and The Ugly  It has its weaknesses  although I enjoy both genres the Italian Western is similar to Noir films  In both cases I havent yet seen any director completely live up to the potential inherent in the material Im not saying it isnt out there  I just havent seen it  But perhaps their weaknesses are inextricable from their strengths  Either way this one is highly recommended for genre fans  and even those who arent may still find it funny and enjoyableThe version of the film I saw was put out by Pop Flix and also times out at  hours as well as having an aspect ratio of   This tallies with the Blue Underground release offered on this product page though BU has some extras that I think deserve consideration  Usually these types of films are completely serviceable in these multipack releases  and the Pop Flix transfer is certainly acceptable  but its dubbed and BU lists Italian wEnglish subtitles as an option  Also included is an interview with Milian and the director Sergio Sollima and a documentary about Italian Westerns  With the inclusion of these extras I would suggest that collectors of Italian Westerns should at least check out the individual release

A169I83JL8QJGN,B000GCFO08,Daniel A Moir,"[3, 4]",Back in the late s we had been playing Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark for a while and the horror fans of the world were already complaining that the game play had began to turn stale Were always crying for innovation especially in films but Ill spare you that complaint Konami answered our cries for innovation by presenting us with a very different kind of horror in Silent HillMost horror games relied heavily on zombies and quick Boo Ahh scare to get its job done Silent Hill didnt do that very often but what it did do was expose you to extremely disturbing images and monsters that defy any conventional explanation Are they Demons Are they undead Or more disturbing Silent Hill s They look like monsters to youThe best thing about Silent Hill was its amazing story which revolved around a young woman named Alessa Gillespie who had extraordinary powers powers her mother Dahlia wanted to use to benefit the Cult of Samael Everything that happened to Alessa was at the hands of her abusive mother including being lit on fire Dahlia even went so far as to misguide and trick Harry into working against Alessa who was trying to prevent the coming of Samael when Harry had to break a seal at a certain place and time where Alessa would be doing some sort of incantation thus halting Alessas progress what Im getting at is that its true that in the Bad and Bad ending of Silent Hill Alessa was the end boss however and it is true that she was the root cause of the twisted world of Silent Hill But the witches Dahlia and the Order AKA Cult of Samael were indeed the bad guys and in the ending I got Samael herself was the end boss I say her because of Silent Hill s revelationsSilent Hill the movie starts off similarly enough to the game that for the first hour or so a fan of the game will indeed be at the edge of their seat waiting and waiting and waiting for the scares to come People who havent played the game may enjoy the story and the visuals but arent likely going to be getting scared by this film either Nonfans will say that they never got the impression that Rose was ever in any real danger The moment death was at hand the enemies Whether they be skinless demon children who now have eyes and mouths making them less creepy or the infamous Pyramid Head Originally a delusion by James Sunderland in Silent Hill  just dissolve the moment Rose is about to be killed thus eliminating any real feeling of dangerFans of the series can simply complain that Christophe Gans strayed too far from the original story While he nailed most of the visuals dead on the plot doesnt seem Silent Hill like at all For a while this film was codenamed Centralia I left this film wondering if the original story was going to be Centralia but that Konami who was seeking to do a Silent Hill film felt that the two were similar enough that they could both save some time and money by combining their efforts This if true hurt the production Silent Hills original story could have saved this production and or Centralia could have been saved by not limiting itself to the Silent Hill universe If Gans wanted to do his own thing he should have instead I now have no way to present the original story that I love to my family members who dont play games and I had talked this one up quite a bitThe first half of the movie as I stated is not scary but is pretty cool nonetheless Pyramid Head doesnt do anything uberdisturbing like his video game counterpart but he does cause a really awesome fatality to one of the unimportant characters Later on when the towns folks start screaming  a witch A witch I found myself feeling nostalgic for Monty Python rather than the original Silent Hill These movie folks need to stop straying for the original materialThe story also starts out following the original plot closely enough but looses critical things like the hallucinogen that the Order was using Dr Huffman was nixed  and although Nurse Garland makes a brief cameo her character is changed dramatically As I stated earlier the original plot didnt deal with Alessa being nearly killed by witch hunters rather being subjected to abuse at the hands of the Order and eventually suffering from being burnt alive by Dahlia which is why in her room you see messages like Mom mom kill and help me Its true that Alessas soul was split up like in the movie but Alessa lured Harry to Silent Hill to help her to defeat the cult of Samael not for revenge against a bunch of witch huntersPerhaps the biggest complaint I have about Silent Hill the movie is the ending I know that Silent Hill spreads It chooses who it wants and when it will let people go Its possible that Rose and Sharon were simply not yet allowed to leave but many people felt that the ending meant that they had died in the car crash similar to one of the bad endings in the original game If this is the case however I do wonder how on earth Gans will follow this film up especially since Alessa is the lead in Silent Hill  Thats right you play as Alessa The bigger problem is that since the th Sense too many writers and directors think that the Oh and at the end theyre revealed to be dead ending is still unique If indeed that is the case here then no Christophe this is not a unique ending Its another me too th Sense rip off If theres more too it than that then it simply was not clear enough for the uninitiatedFor Silent Hill fans it should be noted that although it nails most of the visuals dead on the creepy feel of Silent Hill is lost largely in part for Gans silly A Witch A Witch replacement of the original story Fans will likely feel as I did that the movie is very cool especially visually but will be disappointed that Gans strayed so far from the original plot and that the monsters are under whelming and even misusedOne such example is the demon nurse sequence The demon nurses work well in the game One or two at a time the way they move is extremely creepy but in a large group like this it looked to me like they would break out into the Thriller dance routine It was silly not scary And Pyramid Head should have had a lot more to do with in this filmNonfans will likely walk away with no clue what just happened or what made the game so greatBooks and game adaptations do have to undergo some changes to make them work on film and I understand that However pretty much every video game to film adaptation except Mortal Kombat has been absolutely terrible because they stray too far from the source material Hollywood does their own thing and then slaps a wellknown label on itBut I have to ask if the story from the game is good enough to make one want to do an adaptation then why change the original premise Silent Hill and Resident Evil have both nixed the original protagonists in favor of less interesting female leads I felt more for Sean Beans Christopher than I did for Rose Rose was never in any real danger Christopher was fighting loosing his entire family That element of the film worked well on an emotional level There is no good reason that Harry Mason needed to be replaced with a woman None Whatever excuses Gans throws out there the only reason this was done is because recent horror films have this idea that women should be the lead protagonists in all horror films likely because they scream better than men Fans of Lord of the Rings would have screamed bloody murder for this had Frodo been made a woman I have nothing against women in lead roles In fact in original stories like the Ring or the Grudge I encourage it But if the lead in the original story the film is based on is a weakly thirtysomething male writer who is a widower with a sickly  year old girl it aught to stay that way It is not okay to change the lead protagonist when adapting a book the same reverence for source material that Hollywood has for novels needs to be extended toward video games as wellSimply put this movie would have been infinitely better had it stayed true to the original story but like Resident Evil before it it falls apart when it begins to stray That said unlike Resident Evil this movie is still pretty cool based on its visual meritsWith that said this movie is not unenjoyable and is the best video game adaptation since Mortal Kombat Just dont expect anything super special let alone

started as a hostile takeover became a revolution as you saw the infamous logo almost everywhere  the notes from the theme song are still memorable to this stayall of this can be put into  letters nWo  This is WWEs second and better presentation discussing the history  evolution of this group with new comments from people such as Booker T Arn Anderson Dusty  Cody Rhodes Bill DeMott Diamond Dallas Page Kevin Nash Billy Kidman Sean Waltman Vince Russo Matt Striker Ted Dibiase Joe Hennig Mike Rotundo Big Show Lex Luger along with archival comments from Vince McMahon Eric Bischoff Scott Hall Jimmy Hart and Hulk HoganThe documentary stars off talking about the signing of big stars from WWE to WCW such as Scott Hall  Kevin Nash going into the details of how everything went down  how the timing was just perfect before discussing how things were done to make the perception of the angle look very realistic  the reactions to the reveal of the infamous third man at Bash At The Beach  The new members added to the trio were discussed such as how one man lost his purpose when Eric Bischoff joined the group followed by how the concept of their The Following Announcement was created along with how everything they did looked like real chaos to the point where Cody Rhodes told the story of what his Dad told him when he saw Rey Mysterio threw into the trailer  The popularity of the group was discussed in details about how they were antiheroes to the point where one current WWE superstar had nWo jerseys for his baseball team how that came about with unpredictability  realism and how things got so huge it became its own brand  Issues with the group becoming so large was talked about with them adding any wrestler who had some value with Cody  Joe giving their memories on their fathers being the in the group how it became like a real life gang backstage how some felt it should have been more exclusive with one talent talking about how he was invited but turned it down and how there were so many problems such as the Souled Out PPV that people just started to not care anymore  Stings role against the nWo was briefly discussed before going into the media crossover of celebrities such as Dennis Rodman  Karl Malone  Jay Leno involvement with this group with people giving their different opinions about it including one going as far as to say WCW prostituted themselves  One of the biggest highlights of this presentation was discussed next in the beginning of the end of the group starting to the formation of the Wolfpac the creative control issues how it started to become overkill with other groups how evil always won Vince Russo himself discussing why nWo  failed and the WWE revival of the group before ending the documentary talking about what the legacy of the group with one person probably saying it best We werent the Beatles but we were definitely ZepplinMatches includeScott Hall  Kevin Nash vs Sting Lex Luger Randy Savage  This match was subtitled The Hostile Takeover as this was The Outsiders inring debut after appearing on WCWs television shows for weeks It should also be noted that this was suppose to be a six man tag with WCWs team against Hall  Nash with a mystery partner only for Hall  Nash to go it alone  Luger being knocked out in the opening minutes making this a regular tag team match This was a good tag team match with each man playing to their strengths Nashs size  power Sting  Halls inring ability Savages unpredictability along with Hall  Nash doing the classic double teaming behind the referees back tactics various times The ending with Hulk Hogan transforming into Hollywood Hogan  the birth of the nWo became one of the most infamous moments in wrestling historyWCW Bash At The Beach nWo Back In BlackHollywood Hogan vs WCW Champion Giant  Hogans first match since revealing himself to be the third member of the nWo complete with a new look as he was starting to grow in the black beard with the red  yellow colors replaced with black  white  The first couple of minutes into the match was a game of cat  mouse as Giant initially kept cutting Hogan off from coming into the ring only for Hogan to keep going to the outside whenever Giant executed an offensive move or his offense didnt work  Giant showed he had the superior strength advantage causing Hogan to resort to dirty tactics like pulling hair to keep Giant down  the fight to the outside with both men using the ringpost before Hogan got a taste of his own medicine when Giant hulked up on him  The match itself wasnt much but showcased the new heelish inring style of Hogan with the biggest story behind what happened after the match when the nWo definitely left its markWCW Hog Wild Hulk Hogan The Ultimate CollectionThe Outsiders vs WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat  These teams were almost mirror images of each other as they had the combination of the inring worker Hall  Booker having a bigger  stronger partner Stevie  Nash as Hall  Booker started out as Hall was hip tossed over the top rope at one point before Stevie Ray took a shot on the outside that caused Hall to spit at Stevie before tagging in Nash only for Stevie to take down Nash  give Hall a receipt  Both teams showed that they had no problems bending the rules to their advantage as they used the same tactics against each other such as taking shots being the referees back  double teaming with Sister Sherri even getting involved from time to time before she got caught by Hall  got a taste of machismo for her troubles  This was the only time I recall these teams facing each other which is a crime as they worked well together  had a very good matchWCW Halloween Havoc Allied Powers Wrestings Greatest Tag TeamsSyxx vs The Bounty Hunter  This was only on here to showcase the nWo Saturday Night concept which Nash went into details about on the Legends Of Wrestling on the bluray which was completely different than what you saw in regular WCW matches from the production to the nWo members themselves doing everything from the ring announcing to commentary but the inring action itself was nothing more than just an enhancement matchnWo Saturday Night Nov WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs Steiner Brothers  For those who dont already know about this event this was the New World Orders solo PPV meaning that it was completely different than any other WCW PPV with Eric Bischoff  Ted Dibiase providing commentary Nick Patrick refereeing every single match  a completely different look even down to the fact that only the nWo members had entrance music  The dream match was Scott Steiners second match back after his back injury as both teams were evenly matched  traded momentum throughout the match causing Hall  Nash to take shots on Rick behind the refs back to get the advantage building the hot tag to Scott before all four men ended up brawling with Nick Patrick getting caught in the line of fire causing someone else to take matters into their own hands  Both of these teams would go on to feud over the titles for the rest of the year but this was one of their best encounters in the feudnWo Souled Out WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs Roddy Piper  This was the rematch from their previous Starrcade encounter only with the WCW title being on the line  Piper coming straight from spending a week in the Alcatraz prison before this match  Piper went after Hogan with a vengeance here starting in the isle breaking any rule he can from eye rakes to low blows to choking before even using a chair before taking out other nWo members at ringside  Hogan was able to regain some control working over Piper  trying to keep him grounded before Piper was able to make his comeback but it was an unexpected presence that would not only turn the favor but also result in a new member of the New World Order but overall it was what you expect from Piper  Hogan although not as competitive as their previous match at StarrcadeSuperBrawl VIIHollywood Hogan  Dennis Rodman vs Lex Luger  Giant  One year later after the New World Order was born NBA star Dennis Rodman makes his WCW inring debut here with Randy Savage being in their corner  The match started out with Hogan  Luger going back  forth before Rodman was eventually tagged in complete with him still wearing his bandana  sunglasses showing up Luger with an armdrag before Luger returned the favor arm dragging Rodmans sunglasses  bandana off his face  out the ring but Rodman got more serious leapfrogging  shoulder blocking Luger down before he eventually got caught by Luger  again when he tried to do it against Giant  Hogan  Rodman worked together with double teaming including a hip toss on Giant  double clothesline while Rodman also threw some elbows in the corner before all four men were in the ring at the same time leading to a special appearance  also a Sports Center momentWCW Bash At The Beach Death Match Randy Savage vs Dallas Page  After having an intense feud for over the past  months their final encounter had to be held under rules where it didnt end until one man was the last man standing  DDP came in not wearing his ring gear but jeans  tshirt with his ribs taped as both men started the brawl on the outside with Page choking Savage with his own shirt with Savage targeting Pages ribs with stomps  kicks while also hanging DDP on the ring ropes  both men being so intense that they knocked each other out with a double lariat at one point  DDP went outside of his usual offense pulling moves like a springboard over the top onto Savage but hit his ribs on the guardrail with Savage hitting a double axe right onto the ribs before continuing the brawling not only on the outside but destroying the stage as well  heading back to the ring where a television camera got destroyed  Elizabeth got involved too many times for one womans taste as well  This match was no different than their entire rivalry intense from start to finish  even after the match tooWCW Halloween Havoc Hollywood Hogan vs WCW Champion Sting  The was the rematch from controversial Starrcade the night before with Hogan being in the usual position of challenger  Hogan went on the offense early as he jumped Sting the moment he came into the ring followed by elbow drops  chokes before Sting was able to rebound  took the fight to the outside where Hogan was thrown into guardrails  Both men traded momentum with the referee getting in the way resulting in a bigger controversy in regards to the World Title than we had already had going into the match but it was a better match than their Starrcade one  as a side note this match was shown from start to finish unlike when it was originally airedWCW Nitro Dec No Disqualification Match WCW Champion Randy Savage vs Hollywood Hogan  This was one of the most unique matches in the history of the not only the WCW Championship at that time but also the nWo as the group had officially split apart into two factions earlier in the night with Hogan in his own Hollywood group  Savage being in what would eventually be known as the Wolfpack while it should also be noted that Savage was coming into this match with a bad leg  Hogan worked over Savage with punches  choking along with a chair on the outside while The Disciple got in his shots at well  Savage was able to make a comeback such as using the weight belt but would also end up hurting himself with his bad leg with his offense allowing Hogan to work it over  Things started to get out of hand with the no disqualification rule with various people getting involved before one unexpected person would end up being a difference maker resulting in a match that was as you would expect from these two at this stage in their career with the No DQ rule helping the matchWCW Nitro Apr WCW Tag Team Champion Sting vs WCW Tag Team Champion Giant  For those who dont know the story behind this unique match Sting  Giant were scheduled to face Hall  Nash for the WCW Tag Titles leading into the previous PPV of Slamboree but Giant joined nWo Hollywood the week before the match as they won the tag team titles only for Sting to not join Giant in nWo Hollywood  join the nWo Wolfpack leading to this match where the winner gets possession of both tag titles because these two were unable to work together to defend the titles  Giant walked into the match smoking a cigarette  blew it in Stings face leading to Sting to respond with a slap  attempting a stick  move offense by hitting Giant with moves like the Stinger Splash but Giants size allowed him to block some of these attempts including Sting just bouncing off him when trying a crossbody  powering out of the Scorpion Deathlock causing Sting to resorting to dishing out extra amounts punishment to try to keep Giant down  The match was pretty short  sweetWCWnWo Great American Bash Hollywood Hogan  Eric Bischoff vs Dallas Page  Jay Leno  Leno made his present felt early on as he threw his drink onto Hogan  Bischoff on the outside while also taking a slap at Hogan when he was locking up with DDP with Kevin Eubanks even throwing Hogan back in the ring when he went to the outside before he was eventually the legal man against Hogan playing the game of cat  mouse eventually getting Hogan in an armbar  working with DDP for moves like a double clothesline  Bischoff played the old Bobby Heenan role where he would only tag in whenever one of them was down with Hogan coming into save him whenever he was in trouble but we did get the eventual Leno vs Bischoff showdown  Seeing the names involved with this match Bischoff  Leno you got what you would expect with Hogan  DDP doing most of the inring work with Bischoff  Leno there more or less for entertainmentcomedy relief depending on your sense of humor as it was Kevin Eubanks on the outside who got more physically involved in the match than both Leno  Bischoff  While this was would be acceptable for a match on free TV this match was the main event on a PPV that didnt go over well with critics both in  outside of WCWWCWnWo Road Wild War Games Match  Team nWo Wolfpack vs Team nWo Hollywood vs Team WCW Kevin Nash Sting Lex Luger vs Hollywood Hogan Stevie Ray Bret Hart vs Dallas Page Warrior Roddy Piper  While this War Games match was still contested with a roofed steel cage surrounding two rings the rules were slightly different all the previous years in that there were three teams  you could also win the match by pinfall as well as submission with the person getting the fall challenging WCW Champion Goldberg at Halloween Havoc  This match told a bunch of various stories  had unique situations such as Bret  DDP starting off the match what Stevie Rays intentions were Roddy Piper showing that it was truly every man for himself the interaction between Bret  his own teammates and the WarriorHogan confrontation  This match resembled all the previous War Games matches in recent years where the violence took a backseat to pushing the storylines going forwardWCWnWo Fall Brawl No Disqualification Match Kevin Nash vs WCW Champion Goldberg  Goldbergs streak was at  going into this match with both men taking  countering each others offense causing them to go outside of their comfort zones like going for submissions with Goldbergs anklelock  Nashs cross armbreaker before the hits got more impactful like a punch that knocked Nash down Nash powering Goldberg down with a clothesline Goldberg with a spinning neckbreaker  later spinning dropkick along with a snap slam and even Nash using the low blow  For two guys who have been know to be very limited in the ring they gave a good big man power match with the only negative being the chaotic endingwhich is typical of the nWoWCWnWo Starrcade nWo Back In Black Starrcade The Essential CollectionWCW Championship Match Bret Hart vs Goldberg  This match was during the initial Vince Russo era of WCW  happened the night after Starrcade where we got that screwjob ending in the match between these two resulting in Bret Hart forfeiting the championship  having a rematch here to determine the true champion Goldberg showcased early that he had the clear power advantage before both men decided on the same strategy on working on each others legs with Goldberg executing an anklelock while Bret did a figure four The big picture though was how everything went down during the match that led to not only a champion to be determined but also The Band Is Back TogetherWCW Nitro Dec Best Of WCW Monday NitroHollywood Hogan Scott Hall Kevin Nash vs Steve Austin  The Rock  This was the inring returns to the WWE of Hall  Nash in  years while its been  years for Hoganand also to my knowledge this was the first official time that just the original members of the nWo in Hogan  Hall  Nash have teamed together  Rock was clearly distracted as he kept trying to get at Hogan every chance he had which kept giving the nWo the advantage as Hall  Nash worked him over allowing Hogan to take in  get his shots in whenever Rock was already down while using the strategy of double  triple teaming when Austin was the legal man as well  This was more of a short teaser match for their upcoming WrestleMania X matches but a fun RAW main event overall  as a side note for those hardcore wrestling fans this is the closest youll get to a Stone Cold vs Hulk Hogan match as they did get physical a few timesRAW Mar nWo Back In BlackDVD extras include moments such as Scott Hall  Kevin Nashs debuts Roddy Piper confronting Eric Bischoff the night after Starrcade when Hogan not only confronts Roddy Piper but someone else who keeps dropping the ball and the nWos WWE debut while BluRay extras include various promos from the group  One special bonus on the BluRay edition of this DVD set is the Legends Of Wrestling roundtable that airs on the WWE Classics On Demand channel with this discussion revolving around the New World Order group with Michael Hayes Jim Ross Gene Okerland JJ Dillion and Kevin Nash with them showing various clips some taken right from the Rise  Fall Of WCW DVD to showcase the top discussion at hand  Things started off with Nash discussing who the middle man was doing the negotiations between Scott Hall  Eric Bischoff going into the deals of the contract being offered such as Sting Money  favored nations  The details of some of the concept was discussed next such as if Eric Bischoff really took credit for this idea the type of deal Hall  Nash were working under that would later benefit them what had to be done both infront  behind the camera to put over that the nWo was separate from WCW what was incorporated from crossover music into their own image and who was going to be the third man if Hogan didnt do it  The discussion then turned to the idea that WCW wanted to put WWE out of business with JJ Dillion giving a very detailed answer as to why that was never going to happen regardless of what the ratings were before Nash went into the unorganized issues he had behind the scenes such as royalties for merchandise  How the nWo changed the business in both a positive  negative direction was up next before going into the problems within the storyline with Nash telling his story behind the infamous finger poke of doom  why it didnt work although his timeline for events was WAY off  The controversial mockery of Arn Andersons retirement speech was talked about in detail along with the relationship between all the Kliq members despite being in opposite companies before going into the constantly leadership issues lack of motivation behind the scenes politics the Wolfpack vs Hollywood feud and the legacy of the group ended the discussionThe only real fault I can say is that the documentary only went around an hour long which sucks for those buying the regular version of this set but not that big of a deal for those getting the BluRay as the roundtable went into more details  I liked the matches as they didnt reuse matches from recent DVD releases except BretGoldberg but thats understandable and put a lot of matches that were previous unreleased or so old that its nice to see them released again like the ones from the original nWo DVD a decade ago  In the end I recommend this to a fan of the nWoWCWMonday Night Wars period of wrestling but if your strictly about the matches then the regular version

A3N6AN218WXLXP,B00015EDMK,"Bryan Leech ""Bryan""","[2, 2]",John Cahill has written an excellent and detailed review of the performance and production so I see little point in reiterating his words But I do think the unique nature of the production can benefit from some emphasisAs I always say in my opera reviews one thing that I think is of paramount importance is that all aspects of the production must make a united whole and not like some just a showpiece for a famous singer Here we are lucky to have both as Fleming who I understand prefers traditional productions fits into this psychologically motivated performance with no appearance of being presented as the STAR attraction If you are unfamiliar with this work I feel it is a contender for Dvoraks greatest achievement Although there are definite arias the work is really continuous extraordinarily beautiful melody from start to finishThe story is a subtle one and productions like that from the Met I have given up on Met performances they rely too much on showcase extravagance and the video production usually detracts from the opera entirely miss out on the significant psychology in this story When the opera started I thought the set was terrible But as the story unfolded and its surface simplicity became apparent as a vehicle for something with much greater depth so the set lighting  the detailed mirrored movement on the stage for much of the opera the action takes place on a set divided down the middle and action is mirrored between left and right of the stage You should make up your own mind on this staging but it certainly relates to the psychological aspects of the story And the ballet is the most extraordinarily creative work I have ever seen Not long but it conveys muchWith the DVD engineering allowed a greater presentation of the environment of a water nymph giving the viewer a superior result than I imagine the theatre audience would have seenand it almost seems as if the DVD was the final aim for this production Unfortunately at least on my disc set it is a long opera with Act  on a second disc but it doesnt drag you want more the physical DVD was poorly manufactured In many ways the image was sharp and able to handle rich color almost to Bluray quality but I found dark areas just merging into an amorphous blackness with no greyshades at all Im afraid I dont know the term for this technical flaw Also there was something wrong with the setup options with a tendency to freeze when trying to select audio and subtitle options And this was tried on five players three DVD and two Bluray with costs ranging from budget to very expensive Once underway there was only the problem with dark areas Fortunately the audio is essentially flawlessI have wandered a bit from my original intention of emphasizing that this was a rare and very beautiful opera given a superb performance all round OK one minor role could have been sung a little better but this is carping but quite different to any opera I know Strangely and I guess most might not agree with this but I had a feeling of influence from Wagner but not so deep and more immediately appealing The producers have seized on the unique quality of the work and come up with a unique DVD presentation It wont appeal to all but for those prepared to take on something unusually creative there are many rewardsDont let this description of the deeper aspects of the work turn you away Just buy it and enjoy some of the most beautiful music singing and acting presented most imaginatively in a way that is a rare experience Congratulations are also due to James Conlons musical direction and the excellent playing of the Paris Opera Orchestra This is my second Rusalka the first being from a production for TV

convinced its going to be amongst the as of then months new cult classics The film is not an attempt to attack patriotism per ce It observes patriotism from a lot of angles and not just one or two angles The film deals with the consequences of why the Obama administration and other US administrations had left American Civilians and worked against US interests in such terms as with immigration policies and especially people who have been termed illegal immigrants In my country there are no borders so I dont know with absolute certainty what its like to live in a place with borders Following the flawed policy of centralizing everything  the Obama Administrations decides to declare on its own terms who are to be its allies in battling the problem of illegal immigrationto the point that it keeps losing rather than gaining any votes Despite requests to leave and have themselves replaced by authentic individuals representing those who would elect them to run for themselves rather than to run for persons supporting themselves with private funding while theyd remain in office  the characters representing the Obama Administration tried everything in their power to prevent any real change to occur  resulting in the downfall of the Obama administration and everything it had claimed officially to stand for The end of the Obama administration had come shortly after the Obama characters had come to power  and faced with the overwhelming presence of extreme and furious anger by the American People  the Obama Admin cared for nothing and no one  and kept staying in power  with the official explanation being that they were doing it to preserve the interests of their supporters and the American People with the American People already not wanting them to be in power Hatred  corruption and fear are believed by many to be amongst the many trademarks that stand for the current Obama administration  in light of how it has behaved in regard to US interests and the American People Its undeniable state of undeniable denial is already there before the world to see  and that denial to confront reality and resign from power has caused them to throw themselves into a lake of fire from which there will be no turn  the fire of ceaseless and merciless criticism Understandably a lot of militias and individuals opposing tyrannical government and opression have come together to stop the overwhelmness the Obama Administration has tried to enforce upon the American People against their will  while refusing to listen to public demands and resign or face impeachment Indefinite Intention and the seizure of farms were just two of the numerous things which would never have happened in America if there were not so many idiots allowing that to happen But it happened It is as it is and so people respond with uprising In many ways this films reminds me a bit of Salo  or  Days of Sodom  but is in certain areas a bit more brutal  more intense  and more shocking Perhaps it is after having watched Salo a few times one starts getting used to it and can share it with other members of ones family who will usually remain stiff with fear upon having watched it for the first time The end of the Obama administration is no longer around the corner Its time for the Obama administration to face this end  because that end is the consequences of self  inflicted wounds Society has changed Zionism and extremist centrist politics are no longer tolerated What the Bushes had hoped for  the NWOhas failed to manifest itself as an idea because the presence of intelligent people in this world is far more tangible than theyd have liked to believe  whether their supporters like it or not Undocumented turned out surprisingly good in my opinion  it filled me with a sense of much inner strength I had felt I had been missing during the past days Im an artist and a writer The message of this film is plain and clear the Earth doesnt have to be made into a place where everyone wants to leave Lets make the Earth a place where as many as possible will want to stay on  or Terra  as I guess the Earth will be called increasinglyour planetary home  without any need for everything to be centralized I am truly sorry that my comment is rather awkard  but I give this film five stars Well done Extremely good job After the film ended I wondered what itd be like if somebody from

Amith (kndy),"[4, 4]",In  renown filmmaker William Wyler BenHur Roman Holiday Funny Girl and actor Gregor Peck How to Kill a Mockingbird Roman Holiday The Guns of Navarone would collaborate together to create film adaptation of The Big Country  A film that was based on the serialized magazine novel Ambush at Blanco Canyon by Donald HamiltonThe film would feature an allstar cast starring Jean Simmons Spartacus Guys and Dolls The Happy Ending Charlton Heston BenHur Touch of Evil The Ten Commandments Carroll Baker Giant Baby Doll Burl Ives East of Eden Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Charles Bickford A Star is Born The Men from Shiloh Days of Wine and RosesThe film won an Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor and was also nominated for its musical score by Jerome MorossVIDEOThe Big Country is presented in p High Definition Widescreen   For the most part the restoration by the Academy and the Film Foundation is wonderful  There is a lot of clarity and detail especially with closeups  The contrast is good and although not a vibrant film it still looks better than any video release  The Bluray release definitely brings out the detail in the film  Black levels are good and for the most part and there is some minor flickering mostly towards the top of the film  But that is just me being a bit nitpickyI did notice a problem which were short  Probably the most noticeable was when James goes to talk to Julie at the Hannassey Ranch there is this moment where the picture quality looks distorted  Its only several seconds long but I was surprised to see this distortion for a film that has received considerable restorationBut for the most part the film looks great on BlurayAUDIO  SUBTITLESThe Big Country is presented in English Mono DTSHD Spanish Mono and French mono  For the most part the dialogue is clear and according to my receiver its a monaural track going through both front speakers  So it is a  mix  The good news is that the restoration was faithful to its monaural soundtrack via lossless but anyone hoping for anything more such as a  lossless and immersive soundtrack unfortunately not on this Bluray release But it would have been great to hear Jerome Moross wonderful musical soundtrack via  HDSubtitles are in English SDH Spanish and FrenchSPECIAL FEATURESThe Big Country comes with the following special featuresFun in the Big Country   Presented in standard definition Jean Simmons narrates a short featurette on what the cast and crew are doing behindthescenes during their breakTV Spot   Original television spot in HDTrailer   The original theatrical trailer in HDJUDGMENT CALLThere is no question that William Wyler is one of Americas finest filmmakers  And when it comes to collaborations Wyler and actor Gregory Peck did a wonderful job with The Big CountryAnd what I enjoyed about this film is how it differs from other westerns that are typically focused on violence and retaliation while those elements are in the film to have a character such as James McKay a man from the city who is not so eager to engage in violence and does all he can to stop it You just dont see Westerns with that type of protagonist  Gregory Peck has been known for his activism and as an advocate for peace especially vocal against the Vietnam War and even being put on Richard Nixons enemy list because of his antiwar activism but you can see how conscious he was to showcasing peace without violence throughThe Big CountryThe film would also be important for the career of Charlton Heston  With two big films in  with The Big Country and Touch of Evil working with director William Wyler would eventually unite them for Wylers next film BenHur which would net the actor his first Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading RoleBut The Big Country is a rather interesting storyline that grabs you  You have the rivalry between the Terrills and the Hannasseys  You have the fourway love complexities between McKay Patricia Steve and Julie but what I found most intriguing is the tough love between father Rufus Hannassey and his son Buck  Rufus is a man who grew up with tough love and does the same for his family but within that tough man exterior you wonder how far hell go with his threats  So to see how things progress in the final leg of the film I was really drawn into the film because of that family dynamic between father and sonAs mentioned earlier a lot of star talent in this film and the performances are welldone  The production and costume design are also welldone and capture the look and feel of the west  Cinematography by Franz Planer Breakfast at Tiffanys Roman Holiday The Caine Mutiny was breathtaking but also ambitious  Especially around the canyon scenes and also even during the beginning when the Hannasey boys were showing of their risky horse riding  Even actor Roddy McDowall makes an appearance as a watchman for Hannassey familyWhile a Western among many Westerns released during that time The Big Country is far from being part of the Western banality of films that people are used to seeing from the ss  Sure America loved the Western revengeviolent or actionbased films but to see a film in which the protagonist tries to stop the violence those films are quite the rarity You do get your action but you also get a deep story with good character developmentOverall the restoration of The Big Country on Bluray definitely looks better than its previous video counterparts  While I did see some videorelated glitches I was hoping for a more immersive lossless soundtrack and also was hoping to see more

A17BUW5ZP7J7HA,B00012QLAA,Mr. Cj Jothi,"[2, 3]",Ridley Scott has never instilled confidence in me when I watch his films Granted his visual flair and ability to handle exceptionally grand subjects is a virtue I would not take for granted But whilst films like Alien Blade Runner Black Rain and Thelma and Louise remain standards of their respective genres his recent work has almost diluted into typical Hollywood fare that one could confuse with a number of different directors For differing reasons I have found the following films  White Squall GI Jane Gladiator Hannibal and Black Hawk Down to be extremely disappointing Now I for one am glad so many people have enjoyed these films and I would rather be one of you than merely pass on watching them again I wont delve into my gripes with each film as this review is about one that I have no gripes for at all Matchstick MenSomething is wildly attractive when a film combines the acting talents of Cage and Rockwell and the visionary director Ridley Scott who seems to find the best work in Hans Zimmer and his DOP of recent choice John Mathieson It is a small story on scale compared to Scotts other work Far smaller yet for me one that packs a far greater punchIn a nutshell the film is about a conman one who is afflicted with an OCD that puts his partner on edge To his surprise his daughter of  years old whom he never knew existed crashes into his life What follows is a combination of great comedy and drama that really refreshes your mind when lined up against recent Hollywood fare and should have been recognised in a number of categories of recent award ceremoniesTake my word for it when I say this film is a technical triumph The cinematography editing sound costumes and sets work beautifully to create a comedy that impresses you with its visceral beauty and often leaves you cold with some harsh realities The music by Hans Zimmer augments the visuals much alike John Williams score in Catch Me If You Can by providing a lurid energy that supports the eccentricities of the two lead actors Then in Alison Lohman the audience is enraptured by a sweet young actress reminding you of the initial promise of Natalie Portman And finally the main man himself Ridley Scott To ignore his profound understanding of visuals and mise en scene would be to deny this film of one of its greatest virtues It really is a sight to behold at times begging to be frozen at times just so you can see how light bounces of objects the colour varies and the actors move around the sets His films will always have that quality even GI Jane but finally here he allows the actors to simply perform a quirky heartfelt and wonderfully zippy script The film is not without its flaws but a film of this nature rarely is I enjoyed the final scenes whereas some people found it to be a disappointing resolution Regardless it still entertains on a high levelAnd now the DVD Having been accustomed to these shiny discs since they made their way to England in the late s I have been able to form an idea of what the best DVD is It isnt about the quantity the numerous deleted scenes honestly half the time they are completely unnecessary trailers music videos bloopers EPKs The Making Of featurettes are almost always dry either too short or too long lacking insight and are usually press promos that you wonder why they even bothered in the first place Its about two things quality and a blimming commentary track Now a commentary track does not have to include the director however clearly the most important person when it comes to talking about the craft and meaning of a film But when a film is subject to months of preparation shooting and post then clearly people will have a great deal to divulge Commentaries seem to reveal the most about a film and thankfully here we have the director a writer and writerproducer talking over the film Commentaries of course vary in quality and here we have a very good one Rarely reaching the selfcongratulatory tones often trod on the filmmakers speak about the film as mature adults should with a balanced reverence or pride and objectivity that allows them to evolve as artistsThen you have what is arguably as the amazon reviewer states one of the best DVD features yet made From prep to post Tricks of the Trade is a long detailed offthewall look into the making of this film With seemingly full cooperation with everyone on board this documentary pretty much covers all the main factors of filmmaking scouting locations casting choosing crew safety on set writing adapting from original texts acting costumes set design editing testing on audiences writing music and naturally when things go wrong Just the nature of the doc gives you a wonderful insight into the industry The illconceived notion that making big budget films is a breeze where people are over paid turning up in their limos is challenged here Everyone works extremely hard being as professional as can be to work to a schedule and produce work of an incomparable standard or you dont get hired next time An interesting part of this films creation is during post where Hans Zimmer has to completely rewrite his original score as it completely changed the films intended tone One criticism is the film ignores the sound editing process which is a shame as the sound in this film greatly enhances the storyline and the characters Ultimately Tricks of the Trade shows that the director is a genius A Ridley Scott set seems to be one of the best to work on in Hollywood at the moment and this film and documentary shows you whyThe picture and sound transfers are excellent Wonderful sound mix extremely atmospheric classic sound track crisp dialogue and the visuals are true to the cinematographers achievementSo all in all a great package A film that has already become underrated Scotts best work in the past ten years is in my opinion destined to become a film fans best kept secret Enjoy,5,An

A1W7JW829H45AE,6304457324,"Charles M. Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[4, 4]",First saw Jeremiah Johnson when it was released in the theatres in was captivated by it so much then that a friend of mine and I stayed in the largely empty theatre and sat through it a second time Since  Ive probably rewatched this movie more often than any other and after  years Ive come to the conclusion that what makes it one of my alltime favorite films is something more than the sum of its partsThe movie is only loosely based on the reallife exploits of John Garrison aka John Johnson maybe Johnston but only Jeremiah in the movies a legendary mountan mantrapper whose heyday was from about  to  before settling down and even becoming the sheriff of Red Lodge Montana at the turn of the century He died at age  and after initially being buried in a military cemetery in Los Angeleshe was a Civil War vet was reinterred at his final resting place in Cody Wyoming Robert Redford served as one of his pallbearers at his reburial I have researched GarrisonJohnson extensively since  and it is perhaps final testimony to the legend that precious little in the way of verifiable facts is known about him the real mountan men werent around for publicity The most cited book about his life  Crow Killer by Raymond Thorpe is widely considered hogwash for the most part by the socalled modern expert historians of the Old West But whos to say It may well be that only the most unbelievable parts are true and the legend may even be smaller than the real man And some folks sayhes up there stillNow the movie after  years of reflection as to why I still watch it several times a year it does suffer from not being seen on the big screen as one of the stars of the movie is the Uintah Mountain scenery where it was mostly filmed This is a movie of undeniable atmosphere with sight and sound being paramount to its spell And by sound I mean mostly the sparse unsentimental lyrics of Tim McIntyres songs and the beautiful soundtrack which enhances every scene There is perhaps the least actual dialogue between principal characters that you will ever see in a film but again this adds to the ambiance of the High Lonely and seems realistic for the time and sort of men these were No tenderfoots hereThe acting is first rate and the casting spoton as well I have read that Redford himself has always considered Jeremiah Johnson one of his favorite roles and it shows in his heartfelt performance Acting without words most of the film he is at his bestThere are numerous memorable visual images from this gorgeously shot film but perhaps the most lingering for me is of Johnsons steely face viewed through the flames of his wilderness cabin as it burns away the remains of his wife his adopted son and his briefly happy existence in the wild We know then that what will happen next aint gonna be prettyThe story line roughly parallels what is known of the real Johnsons life but again with a lot of Hollywood revisions though the overall effect is still satisfying and the story never drags or seems dullBut after saying all this there are many other movies Ive seen over the years that have some or all of these elements but have failed to captivate me the way this movie has And so it seems to me that the enduring quality of Jeremiah Johnson is more than the sum of its parts and I think what that is is an intense sense of LONGING that pervades this movielonging for something better something more meaningful something probably spiritual to realize in this life In Johnsons acerbic words It oughter been DIFFERENTThis is a great western classic but in a very subdued unique way It will not appeal to everyone even to many fans of the western genre Im not sure I even classify it as a western myself Its from that period of time when life was hard but beautiful and before the industrialization of the mind of manbut it has a transcendent quality that will always make us want to go backOnly reason I only give it  stars is I

A2OV9UDLHBL2QH,6305262241,Leeandra Nolting,"[5, 10]",Four years ago I acquired THREE separate DVDs of this movie as birthday presents  The respective givers  realized that my birthday was coming up  realized I was about to move to New Orleans and  were at the  bin outside the electronics section of WalMart while making realizations  and   Despite the multiple copies I have only been able to watch this movie twice  The first time my mother felt necessary to point out during the sex scene that you know honey in real life theyre exactly your father and Is age  The resultant mental scarring from that kept me from rewatching this until yesterdayIm one of what Hitchcock disparagingly called the plausibles the moviewatchers who cant get caught up in the action and emotion of the story when there are holes in the plot  To which Id reply fix the damn plot holes Alfred But Ill start off with whats going right in this movie  The casting is pitchperfect  The general premise is pretty good  The soundtrack with the exception of a song Dennis Quaid wrote for it the type of powerballad which would be of great aid to bulimics is fantastic  It makes good use of the onlocation filming in New OrleansNow for what isnt going so good  Someone should have told Dennis Quaid just to talk like Dennis Quaid  The Yat accent is a combination of Southern French and Brooklyn and if you cant nail it dont attempt it  Youll sound retarded  The movie assumes that the New Orleans District Attorneys office is less incompetent and corrupt than the NOPD  This is not true  Pretty much anyone who gets elected here gets indicted sooner or later  When you have the comic relief cops impound a boat for no reason in the first scene it aint much of a surprise when its later revealed that said boat is full of cocaine and the cops are on the take  You never see Ellen Barkin drive a car in this movie yet she can show up anywhere in the city including the other side of the Mississippi River at any time of the day or night at a moments notice  Then she always either gets a taxi or gets a ride back home with Dennis Quaid  This is only possible if she a leaves her car behind for no good reason or b teleports  There isnt fast or reliable public transit in NOLA  Also taxis dont just show up when you call them  Trust me  I know  Dennis Quaid gets called out of a hot date to investigate a triple murder in Storyville  This movie was made in   Storyville was torn down to make way for the Iberville Housing Projects in   Inconsistency andor inappropriateness in underwear  This is one of my pet peeves in movie sex scenes  Most American women wear bras under their shirts as a matter of course whether or not they have anything to put in said bras  They certainly wear them under white shirts  They certainly wear them when it is raining  Ellen Barkin can fill out a bra her character in this movie is certainly not the type to go to work braless she is wearing a white shirt it is raining outsideand in the sex scene she is still wearing the shirt but no bra  It is not feasible to remove a bra while keeping a longsleeve buttondown shirt on  Again trust me  I knowAlso she gets driven home by Dennis Quaid at one point because shes ill after viewing a bloody crime scene  Shes fully dressed and trying not to puke out the window of his car  Then the movie cuts to her vomiting into his toilet wearing nothing but her bra underwear and unbuttoned shirt  Soshes about to hurl but takes off half her clothes first  That just doesnt happen in the real world  Come on  Everybody with half a brain knows Ned Beattys characters not what he seems  Otherwise plotwise hes a completely superfluous character and it doesnt matter that hes about to marry Dennis Quaids motherBut all in all its a

memory servesthis was the SciFi Channels very first offeringI also recall this being a low budget quickieunder two months to makemade up in good old TorontoOntariomy old stomping groundsThe producers refer to its location as an old WW hangarjust outside of TorontoEveryone who knows Toronto will tell you they filmed it at the old Downsview Airportin northwest TorontoThey got Bmovie king Bruce Campbell for the leadpractically Canadian himself as he was born just across the St Clair river in Royal OakMichiganChase Mastersonjust a few years out of her starring role in Deep Space Nine as LeetaROMs girlfriendand the rest of the cast of assorted Canadian talentIs this a classic Lets seeThe film starts off as Brucea convicted murdereris being transported by a couple of correctional officers to another facilityduring a nasty blizzardThey accidentally skid off the road and end up walking to a nearby airportLandlinescellphones and radio transmissions are all outBruce and the two officers hold up temporarily in the cafeteria washroomThere are at least a half dozen more people in the cafeteria itselfincluding two childrenWhile Bruce and the boys wait in the washrooma man of the cloth appears out of one of the stalls and startles the officerswho draw gunswe had seen him ask and enter the washroom earlier in the filmCampbell is handcuffed to some corner pipes and realizeswhen the man asks him if he wants to confess his crimeshe is not a Catholic priestas he wears no collarThe man sidesteps the issue and says he is just a PreacherCampbell disagrees and before anyone knows it one of the guards has been downed by the stranger and killedand the other soon followsCampbell in the meantime has freed himselfhas gotten a gun and fires as the stranger approachesNothing stops him until a well placed shot to the head finally downs the manAs he lays on the floorhe suddenly dissolves awayThis is obviously no ordinary manCampbell soon joins the other people in the cafeteria who thinkas they heard gunshots and as he is the only one to emerge out of the washroomhe has killed the officersCampbell doesnt confirm nor deny what they are thinkingInstead he concentrates on getting himself the heck out of thereprontoThe owner of the airportChasesays there is no way in Hades she is going to fly Bruce anywhere in that blizzardSuddenly a security guard tackles Bruce and they take to the floorThe gun goes off which hits a female patronShe goes downbut not for the countShe also starts to turn and kills a soldier standing beside her before she is taken downand dissolves awayEveryone from now on is in panic modeas no one knows for sure if the person next to them might be an alien of some sort or notThe next person to turn is an elderly assistant to Chasewho is revealed to be one when she goes through an Xray luggage scannerand who kills the security guardThe number of people slowly dwindle down until there are just two standing tall at the end of the filmThey end up both flying off to Canada and freedomfor one of themThe film has some interesting twists in it here and therethe children element being just oneThere is also a bit of humour thrown in such as when the security guards detached hand appears outside the scanner on the conveyor beltnear a sign that says to keep hands away from the beltBruce and Chase do nice work in their respective rolesin fact everyone I think did a good job in their respective rolesThe direction is admirable and for a low budget film it does have some decent production valuesThe script however it pretty pedestrian and is the stuff Bmovie dreams are made ofOne line goesI know were all scaredso am II know I may be picky here but grammatically it doesnt make senseIf were all scaredthat includes meso it

AXLW246TETRY1,1559408855,Lunchbox,"[20, 23]",Pier Paolo Pasolini is a man that I consider as a fascinating director Salograve The  Days of Sodom Salograve o le  giornate di Sodoma was his last film His most noticeable works include Porcile and The Gospel According To StMatthew Well I would like to be clearer on this point and Ill say that the word noticeable here is a synonym of best On the other hand though I would say that Salograve is truly his most talkedabout film if you thought I meant that by noticed The film is good but I really preferred the two mentionned above artistically and intellectually speaking But Salograve has its qualities even though some of us might consider them as flawsSalograve is based on the Marquis de Sades novel entitled Les  journees de Sodome The book of course it was written way before the fascist period in Italy doesnt talk about fascism and the main common point between the film and the book is the main concept The film shows the horrors inflicted to a bunch of young and beautiful people that were selected by four sadistic what a funny use of the word fascists that are only willing to quench their own brutal sexual and violent thirsts They are taken to a villa where the are submitted to the worst humiliations which include being raped whenever the four masters feel the desire to have sex eating feces and later on being brutally tortured and killedThis film is recognized for being one of the sickest of all times one of the most disgusting also Well the shocking content mostly consists of constant nudity of young adults many rapes excrementeating scalping tongue mutilation and eye gouging There are also pretty nasty stories told by a lady whose role in the villa is to tell sick stories that have for goal to turn on the four masters I saw movies that were more disgusting than that sincerely The context and the cruelty surrounding many acts of violence and humiliation in this film are probably the main reason why it shocked so many people The sexuality is never explicit in the way that you never see a penetration graphically the killings are pretty well done the scalping especially but there are very few of them and they are brief I would say that Caligula is way more graphic and shocking than Salograve but less effective thoughPasolinis directing is beautiful He made a mistake in one scene changing the angle of the camera of less than  degrees between two shots Except for that hes fascinatinghes obsessed with showing symmetrical imagesall the time This technique somehow communicates the discipline and the supposedly high straightness of the fascists pretended to have Also the camera often has a pretty wide vision and we dont often really get close to any character With such coldness Pasolini was criticized a lot People didnt know if it was really a statement against fascism or just a good reason to show horrible thingsPersonnally knowing a couple of things about Pasolinis life I didnt doubt one moment about his intentions Yes he had socialist tendencies yes he was a homosexual which fascists hated and yes he was against fascism and it is clear when you see the film People who only watch American films and are used to explicit messages in films will not understand that but this film plundges us into cruelty we could have really compared to the nazis and thats how it delivers its message Maybe too subtle for some but sometimes I think its better this wayjust like in most American moviesan example American History X talks about racismRacism is bad is almost written on the wallsits very sanctimonious its really not subtlebut there are movies where they only show horrible things the way they really are without really giving a judgement in an explicit wayI think it even works better I am a bit tired of moralizers to be honestThe acting is very good Also I got the French Limited DVD of this filmthats the best edition trust me The audio tracks are in french which Pasolini considered should have been the original language of this film because it was the Marquis de Sades and also the original Italian track The one in french is amazing really There are also lots of extras this is really a musthave The actors especially the four fascists are extremely cold and creepyPasolini did a good job directing themOverall the film takes a very neutral approach to the horrors it displays but thats effective Sure this is not a perfect movie it has pretty slow moments and it is not that well structured but it achieves its goal which is to make a statement against fascism,4,Very uncommon approach to criticize fascism,1065484800,"10 7, 2003",man fascinating director le giornate di last film noticeable like be point word noticeable here synonym other hand say

and seems remarkably faithful to the CS Lewis classic the second in a series of seven novels Heres the basic situation Four siblings are relocated from their London home to a country estate to be with an eccentric uncle Professor Kirke  during the Blitz While playing a game of hideandseek Lucy hides in a wardrobe and  like Alice and Dorothy  unexpectedly finds herself in a magical world Later joined by her two brothers and sister Lucy and they become involved in a conflict between what my grandson Cameron calls the good guys led by a lion king named Aslan and the bad guys led by a witch named Jadis at a time when a  curse Jadis has confined Narnia to perpetual winter but without Christmas There is one way to break her curse  best revealed within the narrative  and eventually that happens but not until after a series of adventures which are always entertaining but never threatening to young sensibilitiesAs did Alice and Dorothy Lucy and her companions encounter all manner of strange creatures both allies and foes which include hags soldiers a German pilot Rumblebuffin the Giant red and black dwarves centaurs satyrs wolves Philip the Horse fauns centaur archers and gryphons Eventually after a spectacular battle Jadis is defeated and the curse is ended The special effects are stunning and I especially appreciate anthropomorphism which is never cute The actors who portray the four Pevensie children especially Georgie Henley as Lucy are exceptionally talented  Cloying I can always do withoutI think it would be a mistake to force comparisons and contrasts between this film and any of the Potter and Ring films There are similarities and differences to be sure but none which seems to me to be especially significant I thoroughly enjoyed this film because plot acting imagery and musical score are so brilliantly integrated in the service of effective storytelling Others may find  and either admire or object to  what they perceive to be the films presentation of Lewis Christian beliefs What seems much more relevant to me is the emphasis on values common to all of the worlds great religions and indeed to codes of ethics which are wholly secular Faith for example as well as love courage devotion loyalty selfsacrifice and trust These values are affirmed but only by implication Hence young Camerons immediate grasp of what is good and bad in character and behaviorThe production values are superb the conflicts and their resolution are plausible and the films running of time of  minutes seems just right This is a film which offers a great deal to viewers of all ages As  my rating correctly indicates I highly recommend itThe additional features provided in the twodisc Collectors Edition really are special and include a commentary in which Georgie Henley Skandar Keynes William Moseley Anna Popplewell and director Andrew Adamson participate a production commentary by director Andrew Adamson production designer Roger Ford and producer Mark

A64PKVY0MSBWR,6304744404,"J. Murdoch ""Creative Sparkplug""","[13, 16]",Even though the movie as a whole could have been a lot better I gave it a strong rating because I think its such an interesting premiseIn  the Event Horizon a ship whose purpose was to do deep space research disapears without a trace The entire crew is presumed dead and the public explanation is the ship was destroyed as the result of a reactor that went criticalSeven years later the ship suddenly reappears near the place it was last seen in orbit around Neptune The reappearance is accompanied by a strange transmission that at first doesnt make any senseSearch and Rescue Ship The Lewis and Clark and its crew are sent to investigate although they arent told much more about their mission Dr William Weir the scientist who designed the ship is sent to accompany the crewAs the Lewis and Clark nears Neptune they learn the real reason for the mission Dr Weir explains to them that the story behind the Event Horizon was a cover up The truth is that after a completely uneventful trip the ship simply disapeared shortly after they engaged the experiemental engine that Weir designed The experimental engine was designed to fold space by creating a black hole The idea was that this tehnology would allow the ship to travel almost instantaneously to places in the universe that were light years away The Lewis and Clarks crew are skeptical and wary of the doctors explanation saying that faster than speed of light travel is impossibleOnce docked to the Event Horizon three crew members board to do a preliminary exploration Things start to go wrong immediately Engineering crew Justin goes into the engine deck and the gravitation drive on its own opens the dimensional gateway pulls Justin in and sends an explosive wave that destroys part of the Lewis and Clarks hull making the ship uninhabitable This forces the entire crew onto the Event Horizon which has oxygen and life supprt while the Lewis and Clark is repairedThe remainder of the movie is about things going from bad to worse to life and sanity threatening The crew including Dr Weir begin experiencing very realseeming hallucinations drawn from their very worst experiences and feelings Weir sees his dead wife who committed suicide due to his obsession with work Miller sees a subordinate who he left to die in an onship fire Peters sees her crippled son with twisted gangrenous legs and Justin tries and comes very close to committing suicide in a depressurized air lockOne element that makes the movie so disturbing and scary is in the way you feel like youre experiencing the crews terror and pain The airlock scene where Justin suddenly awakens from his catatonic state and becomes aware that the airlock will be fully depressurized in  seconds is horrible and painful to watch He begs them to open the door as the effects of depressurization basically our skin can no longer contain our blood and organs begin and the crew can only stand and watch his suffering helplesslyAnd then the movie gets even gorier and more disturbingOne point that reviewers who hated the movie seemed to miss although I may be totally wrong on this score is that that violence pain and gore was gratuitous My take was that the Lewis and Clark crew was being slowly integrated into what the ship had becomeSo what did happen to the Event Horizon The answer is never really fully explained but according to Weir who has gone completely insane and sys he now is part of the ship the gravitational drive went beyond folding known space and actually tore a hole in the fabric of our universe into another dimension of pure chaos of pure evilIf you dont apply traditional definitions to what Hell or Heaven actually are did the ship really go to Hell My take is that it went to a dimension that is so entirely different from ours that by our definition it is hellTowards the end of the film the ships log video which shows the crew at the moment before the gravitational drive is engaged and suddenly goes fuzzy begins to play showing what happened the moment after the gateway opens and it looks hellish Crew membes who moments before were grinning shyly at the camera as the captain thanked them as now disemboweling themselves being raped and screaming in pain and terror while they seem unable to stop themselves The captain seems to be struggling with all his might to hang onto a shred of sanity gouges out his eyes and sends the final transmission Liberate tutemae ex inferno Save Yourself from HellThere are lots of loose ends in this film and although it would be more satisfying if they were addressed I dont think it diminishes the effect of the film that they are not There is the question of whether the first crew and Lewis and Clark crew members are really dead or somehow alive and being eternally tortured in another dimension Of whether the Event Horizon is really gone Theres also the question that when the three surviving members are found by a rescue team that anyone will get off alive at the end you see the door hatch closing as rescue members are reviving themI loved the Alien films and although Event Horizon is not at their caliber it is still at times elegant wellacted although I found Sam Niells character to be more annoying than menacing and really really scary If you enjoyed movies like The Exorcist Hellraiser Alien and The

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[0, 0]",Less Than Zero still looks like the MTV School of Movies product it was back in  when that channel beat everyone over the head with the Bengals remake of Hazy Shade of Winter  Matter of fact that song plays almost in its entirety over the opening credits for no other reason than well marketing a soundtrackIm kind of split over this film  It has little to do with the actual plot of Bret Easton Ellis source novel but then again given that Ellis is rarely concerned with plot that doesnt seem to matter much  I dont think theres a single scene in this film that is taken from the book and to some degree the film downplays some of the seedier elements of the source material  In the end its a somewhat depressing film about addiction and what happens when you lose all controlClay Andrew McCarthy returns to LA for Christmas having just finished his first semester at a New England college  Of course in true Hollywood style these people do not look like teenagers nor do they act like most teenagers  A few months translates to massive earthshattering events in their lives  You know the kinds of events that only happen to the stupidly rich and decadent on TV and in movies  You may start wondering why your life was never this explosive at   Clays childhood buddy Julian Robert Downey Jr an underachieving rich kid with a wild side is in some kind of trouble  The spaced out Blair Jamie Gertz begs Clay to talk to him  But Clay would rather get back together with Blair even though he found her in bed with Julian during Thanksgiving breakLong story short Julian is broke the record label his father set him up in after high school went pear shaped his drug problem is out of control and his father wants nothing to do with him  Julian has taken about six months from graduation to spiral downward into debt free base booze and general LAmalaise  Clay seems like the only hope even if hes pretty much a space cadet himselfThe film meanders its only real dedication is in playing song after song in true music video style in an attempt at telling a story  Wasnt Ellis condemning this type of world in the novel  I guess the movie is more concerned with good business than condemnationIm torn between thinking the performances by the two main leads are awful and thinking that they are actually perfect for the film  Ellis characters in the book were not deep  They were a bunch of severely disaffected youth with too much time moneyand freedom on their hands and absolutely nothing to show for it but a bloody nose from bad coke  It was close to impossible to feel anything for any of them and that comes across clearly in the film  The film is not coherent enough to be doing any real moralizing  The characters seem to have grown up too fast and are frankly losersHowever this is really Robert Downey Jrs life story a guy who just cant stop who keeps falling off the wagon gets back on promises to clean up and then screws up again  He is an excellent actor with more talent than the rest of the cast combined  Youre convinced hes not acting half the time  His only rival for performance is the tremendous James Spader as a somewhat sympathetic drug dealer the type of sleazy guy who seems to grow on trees in Beverly Hills  He stalks the hot clubs of LA like a shark looking menacing in the music video light as he hunts down the eversinking JulianWhile Julian was a minor character in the book the absolute lack of depth in both leads makes the decision to tell Julians story a wise one even if it is numbing  Its doubtful that anyone watching Less Than Zero will feel an iota of sympathy but Downey Jr works hard or does he to play someone so completely out of control  He is the main draw here providing a spectacle for the morbidly curious  Less Than Zero is a good title since it describes how much value you can attach to anyone hereOddly enough the ending also foreshadows that later Andrew McCarthy classic Weekend at BerniesThe DVD looks pretty good  The film is heavy on style and the lighting in some shots is expressive and makes for nice eye candy  I liked the scene of the motorcycle gang roaring by the stopped

AHF97M45JFCB,B001HN690O,ONENEO,"[1, 1]",In my opinion DreamWorks has always played second fiddle to Pixar in the computer generated feature film genre  Their rivalry has existed for nearly as long as there has been a computer generated feature film genre Pixar had Toy Story DreamWorks had Small Soldiers Pixar had A Bugs Life DreamWorks Antz Pixar Monsters Inc DreamWorks Monsters Vs Aliens  Pixar with Cars and DreamWorks with Trucks  No wait I made that last one up  But you get the ideaIt seems to me like DreamWorks best efforts are the ones that dont have a direct Pixar counterpart The Shrek saga and How to Train Your Dragon to mention a few  I am of the stance that s KungFu Panda perfectly represents this phenomenon of highquality DreamWorks originalityWhat we had there was a bit of tribute to the KungFu classics with a lot of unexpected character charm to cement the intense action sequences and lovely visuals  When I heard a sequel was in the works I naturally feared for the worst  Generally speaking sequels in the CG film arena are hit or miss with emphasis on miss  Ever see Space Chimps  Hoodwinked  or Open Season  or even scarier Open Season   Sure you have your Shreks  Toy Stories but more often than not it seems to me that animation studios have a hard time recapturing the magic of the originals especially when the original contains the everillusive element of heartThat said KungFu Panda  riding on the success of the first one was given a budget increase to the tune of mil  versus  brought back all of the key members of the original cast with a few new ones and even retained the vast majority of the production  animator crew  To summarize DreamWorks made darn sure not to risk losing said heart of the first film  Did they succeed For the most part absolutely  Viewers looking for something more grandiose may be disappointed but the good news here is that KungFu Panda  succeeds at feeling more like a continuation of the first film than it does a genuine sequel  And considering the first film ended in such a manner where a sequel wasnt necessary this is a very good thing indeedJack Black reprises his role as the titular overweight martialarts trainee panda and his entire Furious Five retinue return uninterrupted Tigress Angelina Jolie Monkey Jackie Chan Mantis Seth Rogen Viper Lucy Liu and Crane David Cross Series staples Dustin Hoffman as Pos master Shifu and James Hong as Pos noodlepeddling dad return as well The villain is new this time a sociopath peacock named Shen and played to perfection by Gary Oldman  Other noteworthy additions include casting reallife karate aficionado JeanClaude Van Damme to play Master CrocThe story takes us back to the visually lush Valley of Peace and finds a newfound camaraderie between Po and his Furious Five cohorts  At just about the same time Po suddenly realizes that he bears no pun intended for now no physical resemblance to his dad the villainous Shen surfaces with a weapon of mass destruction and plans to conquer all of ChinaIn terms of scope the bar has been raised slightly but its clear that the focus here was to expand upon the character backstories and their interaction with one another over expanding geographically strictly for the sake of spending some of that additional milThe plot thickens slightly once Po realizes Shens ambitions and the fact that he doesnt remember his birth parents arent completely unrelated occurrences  Unfortunately though canceling out the slightly deeper plot structure of the sequel is the fact that Pos clumsy lighthearted enthusiasm seems somehow misplaced now that he has been revealed a psychologically scarred Kung Fu disciplePacing is decent if a bit longer feeling than the first though all in all the minute runtime does go by fairly quickly since no time need be wasted setting up backgrounds for our heroes  Hans Zimmer nails the musical score with his trademarked nearsubliminally perfect melodies and heart thumping action accompanimentsIn all KungFu Panda joins a pretty slim gathering of titles that actually manage to do the concept of a sequel justice  While it could be argued that DreamWorks played it safe by failing to stray from the path established in the first one at least they knew not to fix what wasnt broken  The old phrase its not as original as the original certainly applies as well but heres hoping the formula continues to stay fresh as DreamWorks has stated they hope to milk this into a movie franchise  Will fans tire of Pos antics through four more films Theres a swampdwelling big

no dough had dreams big dreams of that one big score that would settle accounts settle accounts with society and settle accounts with that nagging empty feeling of always being short of dough Frank though did not see those dreams coming true from working nine to five and saving his pennies or maybe making some big invention to wow a candid world or hitting a big score on the horses over at Santa Anita truth to tell he was on something of a losing streak just then No our Frank a good looking young guy with plenty of black hair and blue eyes was nothing but a hustler a Bunco guy you know a con artist a flimflam man and so with larceny in his heart he kept trying to figure out the road to that big scoreAnd Frank found it found it like finding gold on the ground in his sunny California homeland  a payroll heist a million dollar heist of the dough for servicemen  for Marines at Camp Pendleton down by Oceanside held over the weekend before payday at a local bank nearby for safe keeping The problem though was that Frank was tapped out broke was moreover way outside his league on pulling this one together way outside his penny ante games small time grift stuff And he needed confederates a few specialists yeggs wheelmen heavy duty rough stuff guys to cope to this caperSo naturally Frank turned to his old comrade in arms in the Bunco rackets the semiretired Mister Flood everybody in the rackets even Frank called him that as a sign of respect for his prowess as a con artist living in luxury and the promoter of few legendary scams to promote this one And Mister Flood and his girlfriend Missy reluctantly bought into this proposition Maybe for the dough never ever discount greed as a motive maybe to prove he could pull off a bank job his one mistake in life which cost him a nickel at Folsom was a botched bank job or maybe just maybe to do the thing for professional pride Everybody agreed hell I agreed that if this caper worked it would go down in the record books hard guys would be speaking in whispers as he passed by on this one for yearsOnce Mister Flood put his hands on the caper though once Frank got him on board like he was somehow doomed by his own ferocious appetites by moving out of his comfort zone the thing became a disaster First Flood came up with the bright idea that Frank and Missy should pose as man and wife for a few months in that little Podunk town where the bank held the payroll in order to case the joint and to set up the caper to become part of the landscape when the deal went down  Of course like I said Frank a young good looking guy who would never want for female company in the s night and Missy who turned out to be tired of Flood fell in love ruffled up some sheets together Then the cast of characters those socalled specialists who were supposed to pull the job off turned out to be something like the gang who couldnt shoot straight Psychos rummies and misfits Which makes one wonder about whether old Mister Flood had lost a step or seven They got the dough alright Mister Flood anyway But in the end it was Frank and Missy turning square that queered the thing up After a dustup with Mister Flood he and wifey

AVTICTX2MD3NR,B005LAIHXQ,Paula Varjack,"[35, 45]",Part ALIEN VS PREDATOR and part Chariots of the Gods PROMETHEUS is a beautiful but convoluted mess of a movie that manages to breath a tiny bit of life into an old franchise but not much elseThe plot  which is more or less explained in the trailers  is fairly simple   years into the future scientists find evidence that aliens have been to earth  and that theyve left a clue as to where to meet them  Naturally we go to find out what all the cave drawings are about and predictably things go terribly wrongConsidering that PROMETHEUS is set in the ALIEN universe something that only the newest trailers even admit to nearly every ALIEN fan will immediately recognize the similarities  the alien world a morally corrupt robot a large corporation with it own designs and lots of space ship stuff both alien in nature and human  Which is all well and good but somehow returning director Ridley Scott and writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof still manage to step on their dicks despite a massive budget and familiar stomping groundsThe plot is simple which is fine it is a prequel to a movie whos sole original purpose was to have someones chest explode from the inside out after all but so are the characters  all very one dimensional very flat  Some of thats because its just not a great cast  the Ripley type character is played by Noomi Rapace who is a fine actor but simply doesnt have either the charisma or physique to pull off her role in this film  Other roles are just as flat  Ironically only Michael Fassbender as the robot is interesting in the slightestBesides the flatness of characters they also act unbelievably  a death knell for any scifi movie no matter how big the sets  Characters take off their helmets in whats clearly a fd up looking spaceship where shits gone wrong  cause thats safe  When they discover what should be the biggest thing in history they seem no more amazed then if they had just bought a Happy Meal and the toy was broken  They then leave that discovery because it will be getting cold outside  not  degrees below zero cold mind you just cold  I guess the trillion dollar expedition forgot to bring matches for a fire  Just totally unbelievableNo sense from the script which is set so relatively near in the future if theres even been any other alien life discovered before this trip or even when warp drive was discovered  It doesnt seem like the adventure of a life time to these characters which of course it should but more like a pain in the ass trip to the corner store for diapers  When they see the giant human head statue found on a deserted world in the middle of dead space no one bats so much as an eyelash  Absolutely the wrong tone  Even the characters in the original ALIEN  who were nothing but glorified space truckers  took more glee in their potential discoveryEqually stupid are the characters actions  Somehow  characters get lost  feet from the front door of the alien ship then even more inexplicably are left behind there bc no one knows theyre missing  One guy gets infected by what I guess is an alien but says NOTHING you know even though theyre on a trillion dollar scientific research spaceship  Just dumb both in believability and in toneJust as wrong in tone is the music which half the time is brilliant when he channels Jerry Goldsmith and the rest of the time is just awful  For some unknown reason Scott must have instructed composer Marc Streitenfeld to write hero music for the Prometheus alien which any time its played take one immediately out of any sort of suspense that might have built up to that point  Absolutely stupid and again it makes one wonder just how Scott could have made such a plainly wrong decision  it is a horror movie after all right  At other times when the shit hits the fan the music is so loud and so wrong that it literally kills any danger that characters you barely care about might be inAnd lastly the continuity errors  Just oodles of them when compared to the original including two so huge they had to be on purpose didnt theyIn the end you really have to ask yourself why this movie was made  Whatever it does for the storyline could have been done in about a  of the screen time  and regardless of the storytelling or lack thereof it covers much of the same ground that ALIEN V PREDATOR did without ever telling the audience whether or not we should consider that movie canon or not  If I sound frustrated thats because I am  The ALIEN universe is a cool one with more then enough storylines to do something new  The revelations this movie shows us are A predictable and B underwhelming both in scope and execution  At times just when you think the movie might pull its feet from the blah mire its in and reach something special it falls right back into the goopSimply put a movie set in that universe with a  plus million budget aught not be so average  It feels like it should be a great film or at least a very good film mostly because of the amazing sets and CG work but in the end its terribly blah  In the end Id have to say that AVP is actually a better movie bc while that film doesnt reach nearly so high it does actually achieve what it sets out to doHate to say it but after ROBIN HOOD and now this its clear that Ridleys lost itBOTTOM LINE   I think Michael Fassbender looks like a young

nervously on the edge of your seat while a collection of frightening contingencies holds sway over the lives of the participants  As with any good prison movie youll find yourself uncertain going back and forth about whom to cheer for  Who are the good guys and who are the bad guys  And what is the source of this doubt and confusion  Am I a hopelessly misguided bleeding heart or what  Yes a firstrate thriller and a firstrate prison move but a good deal moreCell  is fundamentally a movie about the uncertainty that usually unnoticed pervades modern life the risks that are not acknowledged until circumstances and happenstance force them upon us  We are typically oblivious not even offhandedly acknowledging the things that could go wrong  If it were otherwise wed go mad because there are just too many unforeseeable horrors  If youre naturally lucky or exceptionally privileged the forcefeeding of unexpected and terrible outcomes can be minimized  After all rich people dont become prison guards and rarely go to jail  But the risks even for them are never completely eliminated  Thats just the way the world works  Thats why risk assessment has become formally institutionalized in modern organizationsEven those who are ostentatiously cynical and who complain about the bad hand theyve been dealt or the corruption and incompetence that pervade our world are vulnerable to the nastiest surprises  Cynicism is no safeguard against being taken frighteningly unaware  Pain and loss even at their most abstract and inclusive dont exhaust the demeaning brutalizing identity destroying outcomes because they so often come as a complete shock totally unexpected taking forms that never occurred to us and bringing to the fore thoughts and feelings that were once alien to our nature but now shockingly we harbor themWhy so  Because whatever our character we have come to trust the world thinking we know how it works that there will be no real surprises passing judgment and making decisions without recognizing that everything rests on a shaky foundation  Modern institutions whether the criminal justice system politics religion medicine marriage and the family  extend the list indefinitely  provide us with a repertoire of commonsense expectations based on totally inadequate maninthestreet knowledge When the expectations arent met when prison guards beat to death innocent women and do so with impunity we become outraged confused wary and mistrustful  But eventually we calm down and go back to equanimity back to a marginally modified but still intact set of expectations and takenforgranted assumptions that trick us into making the world livable  Most of the timeOn occasion however the failures of modern society and the institutions we take for granted even as we sardonically berate them take a toll too heavy to bear  We see life for what it is a crap game with rules that are routinely broken in countless ways for countless reasons and even the people closest to us may let us down if only because they are mortal and may simply die leaving us alone  The arbitrary conventions that made the world interpretable and trustworthy are so badly out of whack that we retreat into psychosis betray brethren die prematurely from one natural cause or another ineffectually rebel immerse ourselves heart and soul in a meaningless social cause or just quit which may or may not involve suicide  This is the world that gave rise to a place and locus of activity with the sterile bureaucratic designation Cell But lets stop for a moment  This is a prison movie  The convicts deserve to be where they are What happens happens  Right  In this case there are notable exceptions conspicuous institutional failures and these are just the plainly obvious ones and they are not the only victims  One failure begets another  For the long term we have a dark chilling desperate view of the world in intense microcosm  So yes Cell  is a thriller and a prison movie

A190KRNWI4E0H,0790729385,Michael Ciardi,"[5, 5]",Theres few horror films that you can return to and still find something genuinely frightening each time One exception is s The Exorcist based on the best selling novel by William Peter Blatty who directed and wrote The Exorcist III based on his novel Legion which represents the true sequel to the original novel In this film William Friedkin directs with a terse methodical approach which lends the film an aura of authenticity despite its outlandish theme But as fans of the novel and film know well Blattys novel is based on one of the few documented cases of demonic possession which occurred in Georgetown in the sOkay so what makes this movie so frightening to most Friedkin provides a nice introduction to the film in the  DVD release which is not included on The version youve never seen In that introduction Friedkin accurately explains that people take from The Exorcist what they choose If you see the world as a dark and evil place Friedkin notes then you will focus on those elements but if you believe that a force of goodness exists to combat the evils of this world then you will take what the filmmakers wanted you to leave witha feeling of hope and faith that goodness can prevail against evil no matter how sinister in natureMost of those reading this review may have some notion about the focus of this film In a nutshell a young girl Linda Blair is possessed by an ancient demon who claims to be the devil and two priests one faltering in his faith and the other old and feeble join forces to compell the spirit to leave the childs body The acting is supurb by all those involved Jason Miller Max Von Sydow Ellen Burstyn Linda Blair and Lee J Cobb are so convincing that every word they utter rings true Honestly theres not a bad performance in this entire cast and the dialogue is simply fantastic Freidkin is a skilled director and the film has a documentarylike feel to it and despite having Catholic priests both real and acted in the cast the film is never didatic or panders to those who are ignorant and waiting for a cheap thrillThe Exorcist remains the greastest horror movie of all time because it wasnt made for teenagerslike so many are today This is a thinking persons movie Its creepy in every aspect but the most frightening scenes are those where you least expect it For example the sequence of hospital tests on the young girl are disturbing beyond anything that the demon might do This film takes itself seriously and we are drawn into the horror because everyone is convinced that this is realthis could really happen and it supposedly didThe words Could you help a poor Altat boy father are uttered by a homeless man in the subway Father Karras Jason Miller encounters the man and then turns his back on him thereby turning his back on the impoverished humanity this homeless man is meant symbolize Later the demon utters these very same words to Karrasechoing the homeless mans words precisely How did the demon know Surely the demon has the ability to see beyond the confines of Regans bedroom Ah its the unanswered questions such as these that makes this film so intriguing Watch it once then watch it againbut always watch it after dark with the lights turned low The sound is just as masterful as every other aspect of the film This film is for adults only of course and I think even older teenagers arent mature enough to understand the more subtle elements of horror here Times have changed and horror films have become increasingly violent and gory but this wonderful film from  has never been duplicated in the sheer amount of terror it delivers I suspect that it will continue to haunt the minds of its viewers for years to come,5,"Could You Help a Poor Altar Boy,

A1C58YXM2A30CY,6303042198,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[3, 3]",First off the DVD made by MGM The Lodger The Story of the London Fog is an amazingly great package they put togetherNot only is this great silent picture meticulously restored but you get two different scores to choose from a funny story from Hitchcocks granddaughter Mary Stone a Making Of featurette two interviews with Hitchcock done in the early Sixties commentary by film historian Patrick McGillian and a  radio show also directed by HitchcockOK so I hear all the hype the first Hitchcockian thriller the best film to come out of Britain at that time first rate must see etc  Is it trueIn watching the film the first thing you note is the German Expressionist film artistry that Hitchcock picked up from his time in Germany during the time of FW Mirnau and other great silent directors of the time  Their experimentation with light tinting and shadow are evidentHitchcock created his own brand though cant accuse him of being a copycatBriefly the film starts out with a screaming woman with lightcolored hair as shes being strangled her hair all aglow  On the side we see a marquee ToNight Golden Curls  PropheticThe Avenger is a serial killer loose in London  The police are ineffective as this murderer kills any blondes he sees  It gets so worried women purposely wear dark curls under their hats so they wont be mistaken for blondes  No peroxide for me one woman quipsThe Avenger though as bad a mass murderer can be is secondary to the character of the Lodger played by British silent film star Ivor Novello and his budding relationship with Daisy who is unfortunately blonde and who unfortunately for her police detective fianceacute is falling for the LodgerThe Lodger is not really given a name which I thought was interesting  The suspense builds as the landlady and then the exboyfriend police detective Joe begin to suspect that the Lodger is in fact the Avenger  More and more clues are led up to a search warrant and the emptying of a mysterious satchel the same kind of satchel that witnesses had said belonged to the AvengerInside we view a map with little triangles all over it where murders were committed and newspaper clippings of the Avengers bloody trail  And a portrait  Your first victim eh snarls JoeUh oh doesnt look good for our man  Daisy adores him and cant see the Lodger being any kind of murderer  Is Daisy naive or is she about to be pluckedThe artistry of the film is amazing  The swinging ceiling lamp suggests pacing back and forth by the Lodger in his room  We seem to see through the ceiling to see his nervous pacingIn fact Hitchcock had a large six foot square thick pane of glass used to shoot through to the pacing young man then superimposed the glass image with the ceiling imageSuspensebuilding such as the white hand that is slowly going down the staircase as the Lodger is making a mysterious exit from the lodge to some unknown destination or errand  The number on the lodge door   naturallyHistorySeeing the making of featurette was very educational  You hear Hitchcocks own words about his German influence and how the studios did not want their prize boy being accused of murder  He states that he found the same with Cary Grant in Suspicion  No one wanted Cary to actually be the murdererDespite the star system crimping his style Hitchcock conveys all the mystery and suspense in this great silent picture tints and all Hitchcocks trademark personal cameos and the nowfamiliar themes of suspicion and mistaken identity are all hereHighly recommendedPS  I also have the Laser Light DVD version  That one is not restored and is difficult to see  Get the Premiere Collection from MGM,5,"In Silents, No One Can Hear You

injokes and is just fun from endtoend And cameos Rocky and Bullwinkle also look and sound pretty good  the voice of Rocky but not Natascha obviously since Rene Russo plays that character is by June Foray who did the original voice of Rocky but new voices were found for Bullwinkle and the Narrator whose original voice actors had passed away in  and  respectively The new voice of Bullwinkle is okay perhaps a bit higher in pitch than the original this is unfortunate given how important that goofy voice is to any Rocky  Bullwinkle story and how easy it is to imitate Bullwinkle but thats the only negative point in an otherwise excellent adaptation The narrator for example is tops and we even get a little bonus feature when we get to see how hes spent the last  yearsThe opening ironic animated sequence is probably funnier than any of the original animated shows which I love so I dont say something like this lightly summing up  years of retirement for our two chums The screwball plot involves evil dictators who become studio moguls so that they can turn the people of the world into zombies by subjecting them to really bad television RBTV through inane shows like Three spies and a horse who is also a spy everyone including the horse wear shades  theres a Dudley DoRight reference here as well given that theyre riding the horse backwards Funny visual pun about a mole in the white house another about the green light for the film project hilarious Minnie Mogul in a Hollywood studio shredding scripts that are too intelligent Robert De Niro plays Fearless Leader and theres a great scene of him boogying with Boris and Natascha to Secret Agent Man Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo did the soundtrack and this is one of the songs the band covered He also awkwardly parodies his own

Liberty in a scene as Supertramps Dreamer plays and you really dont hear a lot of Supertramp these days The good guys get turned into vegetables literally and one of them even becomes a flaming carrot Bullwinkle surfs the information superhighway who uses that term any more for some unintentional humor at last and we look on lovingly as the TV stations name changes from Really Bad TV to Rocky  Bullwinkle TVPiper Perabo plays Karen Sympathy a goofy FBI agent whos the only real new character in the show other than a few anonymous cameos Randy Quaid as her boss for example John Goodman as a cop Jonathan Winter in several roles Whoopi Goldberg as a starstruck judge and others Jon Shapiro has a cameo in the film as well making that two The Big Leboswki alumni to appear n the film alongside Goodman WowThe DVD comes with a featurette that mostly sets up the plot and brags about how it will appeal to all demographics even teenage boys wholl like Piper Perabo The film came out in  but theyd

Postlethwaite Perseus Sam Worthington grows to manhood and ekes out a simple but happy existence as a fisherman on the Greek straits with his adopted family But storm clouds gather inexorably on the horizon the Kingdom of Argos infuriated by the cruel indifferences and vicissitudes of the Gods has declared war on the omnipotent rulers of Mount Olympus themselves Almighty Zeus Liam Neeson angered by the impudence of his creations unleashes his banished brother Hades Ralph Fiennes upon the face of the Earth in order to teach them a lesson Perseus family are amongst the first casualties of Hades slaughter and driven by inconsolable rage he resolves to destroy the very ruler of the underworld himselfClash Of The Titans is a splendid remake of a very silly but fun film Because lets be honest as enjoyable as the original was it was never a classic  not even at the time of its release which I remember very clearly The original was a giant cheese football of a movie and this film is also a giant cheese football of a movie the thing that they both have in common is that theyre both completely enjoyable largely because neither one takes itself very seriously at allLike most of the best remakes Clash Of The Titans reworks the concept of its progenitor in order to go somewhere a little bit different This film is a little darker than the original and in a suitably Ouroborosian twist has clearly been influenced byGod of War Collectionan excellent PS game which was itself very clearly influenced by the original Clash Of The Titans  to the point that Harry Hamlin the actor who played the original Perseus voiced a character in God Of War  But while this film may favour a slightly darker tone director Louis Leterrier  who also made the fiendishly enjoyableThe Incredible Hulk Widescreen Editionwith Ed Norton knows what made the original work and CGI effects aside keeps this film very much in the style of camp eighties fantasy movies likeKrullThe BeastmasterandConan the Barbarian  Collectors Editionwhilst throwing in some very subversive humour and the odd nod to the original the brief cameo from Bubo the rather naff clockwork Owl from the original had me in fits of laughter largely due to the way it was playedPersonally I think Clash Of The Titans stands head and shoulders over most of the bilge that has filled our cinemas lately Sam Worthington makes a doggedly rugged Perseus the rest of the cast including Mads Mikkelsen Liam Cunningham Vincent Regan Polly Walker and the gorgeous Gemma Arterton all do a cracking job and clearly have fun doing it Liam Neeson wanders around in a silly beard and armour Ralph Fiennes throws in a combination impersonation of Terence Stamp in Superman  Nicol Williamson in Excalibur and Richard Harris in Gladiator and the film as a whole is generally just a good allround oldfashioned fantasy romp which doesnt take itself at all seriously and is over in under two hoursFrankly I really have no idea why this remake engendered so much hatred at the time of its release and I genuinely dont know whats going on with audiences these days They shower praise on simplistic portentous drek such as Avatar like its a rediscovered Tolstoy novel yet they cant enjoy a good oldfashioned fantasy flick which plays fast and loose with Greek mythology in a deeply amusing manner and which is merely the latest in a long line of films in

story of two lives that change forever after Mary who lives in Melbourne Australia chooses at random an American name out of a Manhatten address book as a pen pal and enters into an unlikely friendship with Max that turns out to span twenty yearsUnlike most claymation films this is not a childrens movie It is more for a mature audience as over the course of the film the characters write about and deal with alcoholism kleptomania religion depression agoraphobia and suicideLonely eightyearold Mary Daisy Dinkle voiced by Bethany Whitmore only finds joy in watching her favorite television show The Noblets while consuming sweetened condensed milk since her mother is an alcoholic and cannot stop borrowing items from the store by stuffing them under her dress and her father hides in a room alone all day drinking Irish Cream She has a birthmark she is embarrassed about and has trouble making friends until the day she decides to find out more about how life in America is different from her life in Australia Little did she know she would select someone who needed a friend just as badly as she didFortyfouryearold Max Jerry Horovitz voiced by Philip Seymore Hoffman attends Overeaters Anonymous and suffers from Aspergers syndrome that keeps his estranged from others and obsessed with the problem of littering The strangeness of this new interaction with someone by letter causes him great anxiety due to his condition but the writing helps him come out of his shell slowly and open up to Mary By confessing their hopes and dreams and worries to each other they both move closer to living fullcolor livesAt times their relationship is estranged due to Marys growing up falling in love and studying psychology to learn more about Max When Mary grows up she is voiced by Toni Collette and her romantic interest Damien is voiced by Eric Bana The back and forth of their friendship and the trials they both face in their lives are saddening and sobering They both deal with very serious issues in a slightly humorous way due to the style of claymation This is a unique film its no familyfun Pixar or Dreamworks because even though it has so much funny letterwriting the story itself is very sad and deals with really serious mental and psychological problems people have Wait for your children to reach a mature age before sharing this film with themBonus FeaturesThere is a making of featurette composed of a series of odd scenes pieced together of the director arriving on a segway and riding the length of the studio to one person destroying a miniature set with a big mallot to a short interview with Eric Bana about how short his part was to someone receiving a ticket from a cop It is very random and has little to do with the making of this film The behind the

A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B002S0OB8M,David J. Brown,"[0, 0]",Wes Craven has had a rough decade since the Scream franchise finishedthough the fourth film is now out and doing well  Scream  felt rushed and tired It lacked a lot of the wit and true twisted surprises or the previous films  Cursed was a total and well publicized disaster that barely worked as a horror movie or a spoof Now outside the horror genre Craven has been very successfulnot counting his producing credits on two remakes Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes of his classics with the very underrated and suspenseful high concept thriller Red Eye and the drama Music of the Heart  Being a huge Craven fan Ive been waiting with baited breath for his triumphant return to kickbutt horror  I thought I would get it when the first trailers for My Soul to Take appeared  Well I was only half rightFirstly when the trailer heavily advertised that the film was in D I knew I was in for a film that the studio wasnt  percent behind  Does horror real horror really need to be in D  Does it really add anything to the scare factor  YeahI dont think so either  Then when you see scenes in the trailer that are not in the film but on the deleted scenes section you get the sneaking suspicion that there were other bigwig hands in the kitchen outside of the director  Despite having made more than three hugely successful films in the horror genre there are still folks who dont give him final cut and tamper with this films  My Sould to Take is sooooo loaded with longwinded scenes of characters expousing long lines of dialogue about the plot that it becomes exposition overload  Weirdly enough the more the plot and concept is explained the more muddled it seems to getI love the concept of this film  Its the usual high concept type of horror that Craven usually writes whether he succedes or not  It revolves around seven teens all born the night that the Riverton Ripper was supposedly caught and killed  The seven teens are all different but know each other one way or another  Riverton Ripper style killings start to crop up and the question arises is the Ripper alive and back at his old trick or has his twisted and apparently schisophrenic soul jumped into one of the seven teens born the night he died  The film answers these questions with great zest but over explains them to the point of drowsiness  Its unfortunate to see a film sink by the weight of its own conceptThe acting is all fine  The kids all seem real and offkilter in some cases The final act chase suspense scene is well done and in the Craven ScreamNightmare on Elm Street tradition It all goes down quite satisfyingly until the villain is revealed and his endless dialogue regarding why he is the villain is produced  The only real creepy moment happens early on on the celebration of Ripper day  A teen walks alone down a bridge to find a masked figure just charge at him and unforgivingly slash him to death  Its simple to the point and felt very real  The opening moments in the past where we meet our schizoid original Ripper are great too  The opening just builds on itself with one surprise after anotherThe blu ray looks great as all Craven films do even the older lower budget films  The special features are lackluster I must say  The deleted scenes more importantly the alternate opening and alternate ending should have been included in the films final cut  The alternate opening has a visual reference to Cravens Nightmare Elm Street plus it reveals why the film is even called My Sould to Take  Maybe it was deleted because the remake of Nightmare on Elm Street has a similar scene which is a direct riff on Cravens scene in the original Nightmare  Dont know but wouldnt be surprised if that was the case  Finally there is one alternate ending where it is revealed VISUALLY without tons of expositional dialogue what our main character named Bug is and his purpose regarding souls  Its great kind of touching and a little chilling  Why were these things removed  They make the film stand out of the usual slasher stuff  The commentary track is okay  I really loved Cravens tracks for Hills Have Eyes Nightmare and his shared commentary with Kevin Williamson on Scream  The actors and Craven go into detail on how things were done but not much in the way of what they mean  And there is a ton of visual metaphors floating in this film involving condors and such  Its more technical and jovial than I wouldve preferredThe movie is not as bad as youve heard but it isnt that good either  I didnt hate it but I have no real reasons to gush over it either  The concept is good and there but seems buried  The film feels like someone with the money got cold feet once the film was completed and started asking for reshoots and padding  I think horror should be more abstract  There doesnt always need to be an explanation that fits neatly in a box  Ive always contended that the unknown is far scarier  To quote Billy Loomis Did they ever really explain why Hannibal Lector liked to eat people  NO dont think so  Hardcore horror fans will most likely be disappointed as well as Craven fans  I put this film in the same catergory as Scream  Vampire in Brooklyn or Shocker as far as the Craven cannon goes is not quite awfulb ut its not memorable and you know it couldve been so much more,3,Me thinks Wes Craven should stop working for major studios for a while.,1303171200,"04 19, 2011",rough decade franchise fourth film now out well lot wit true twisted previous total well disaster barely horror movie spoof Now horror genre very

A1IUH51WI1TTSP,B0001Z4P3C,Sam A. Milazzo,"[10, 12]",I remember watching this series on TV when I was little along with many other animes Oz and not and Im glad to have this japanese take of Oz on DVD  I used to borrow videos of Wonderful Wizard and Emerald City when the stores were open and of course theyre gone now but thats why Im grateful for the DVD Collection even in its not so good condition Im working on the reviews for the individual DVDs  One of the best things about this animation is that some of it not only goes back to the original books but some of its characters appearances pays homageis modelled after previous Oz eg Tin Woodman is fat just like Oliver Hardy in  Scarecrows arms are lined up just like Denslow Lion resembles the costumes worn on stages and in the silent films Emerald City is white because of the White City in s World Columbian Exposition in Chicago which inspired Baums Emerald City etc  the streets and houses are own the lower level while the Palace is at the top  As for the designs for the Witches of Oz they were GREAT  Glinda despite being pale and blue all over intsead of redandwhite looks just like Athena the Greek Goddess of Wisdom which matches her personality perfectly the Good Witch of the North and Mombi were both well thought up the East Witch took up the dark cloak with pointy hat and the Wicked Witch of the West possibly modelled after the  Russian StopMotion animated version which I wish I got the DVD of earlier with her fingerless gloves long bushy white hair with red streaks thick black dress with occassional hood long pointy red shoes and pale skin was PERFECT  I just wish that Dorothys long brown hair was in braids just like Denslows drawings and that Ozmas design be a combination of Dorothy and Glinda even if it would resemble Emma Ridleys portrayal of Ozma in Disneys Return to Oz  As for the Magic Shoes when the Wicked Witches have them the shoes are big brown baggy and curlytoed but when Dorothy has them then they are childlike with straps a white surface possibly silver and notso pointy toes and they usually glow pink andor white  More character design descriptions will be in the other DVD reviewsSince there are a LOT of Deleted ScenesEpisodes many references the characters make on the final English Movies DVDs are ACTUAL Scenes that you can see on the FullTV DVDs from YesAsia  Despite the cuts I still Like the movies Very Much because the music voices designs and stories are great and teh most faithful to teh original books storiesAnd in case youre wondering Who is Margot Kidder the Narrator she was LOIS LANE during the  Christopher Reeve as Superman Movies  Although many of her lines are unnecessary  she sometimes says things we can already see for ourselves and it makes the feature seem a bit more childish its still okay to listen to  her job possibly came onto the Video release rather than the actual TV Show itself  The fact that there was a lot of editing would explain the gaps and strange bits on the English VideosDVDs and any deleted bits get a little mention  All  DVDs have the same Main Menu Setup and the same Special Features Main Menu SetUp Searching for a Dream breifly plays as the opening tornadowith yellowbricks etc creates the title of the movie which then minimizes in the top left corner allowing room for Play All Chapters Additional Titles and a starrycircle that plays stills from the feature to appear on the screen  Except for Wonderful Wizard the Oz DVDs have the opening song play in the main menu  Land of Feelings plays on both Emerald City and Wonderful Wizard menus  The Menus for the Scenes and Additional Titles are silent There are only  Chapters having titles that could be from the actual TV Episode titles although the packaging unfortunately makes some spelling mistakes Glenda Dorothy Magic Powers etc Additional Titles This menu has a look at other Lightyear Entertainment VideosDVDs and is on every DVD  These are People A Musical Celebration My First DVD and Stories to Remember which is animation for families and little childrenAnother thing I should point out is the Logo  If I recall the video correctly  Wonderful Wizard had a sneal peak at Emerald City and that started with this discolike music playing as colourful lights shot across the screen forming a little shooting star  This time on the DVD before the Menu sets up there is a Beating of Drums as a black page turns over to yellow as Lightyear Entertainment and its site name appear in flashes  Except for the music it does the same thing at the end of the moviesThese features would be a lot more enjoyable if there had been a bit of better writing and the videos being cut into  hr  mins instead of  hr  mins  therefore we might have been able to have a bit more of the original book bits  Despite having no subtitles the same old sneak peaks and not so good picture quality I am grateful to at least have these to keepA GREAT site to visit is landvanoz  com starts with small L without the spaces which has a comic strip of the series showing bits rarely seen in EnglishBUT    if you REALLY WANT to get the COMPLETE EPISODES then you may be interested to know that the TV versions are avaialble on two different Boxed DVD sets in French at Manga Distribution under Le Magicien d Oz and ChineseJapanese at Yesasia  com  which is better because unlike Manga the online store is in English  I have the CJ version and therefore the following information Each box set has a DVD with  disks with  episodes lasting over  hrs  All Disks have the same cover design as the BoxSet they come in the same Menu only difference is the volume number and the same options of looking at other ChineseJapanese DVDs  Each DVD plays as follows opening tile  episode and next ep preview with end credits  The Disk automatically plays Chinese Audio and Subtitles but you can change the audio to Japanese  But just like the English DVDs the picture quality on the ChineseJapanese DVDs change sometimes one shot can be excellent while another can be darkdim and another can be quite bright  Even in a foreign language I could make out what a character was saying quite a few bits eg names sound close to english and easy to hear on the first time  Box Set  has  DVDs therefore  disks each with  episodes while Box Set  has  DVDs with  disks but with the last DVD having  episodes on the last  Disks resulting in over   hrs  The foriegn music certainly is different to that of the English and sometimes sounds better while a few other times isnt as good and if you had this collection you wouldnt be able to watch even  minute without finding something cutout replaced moved to somewhere else or even  episodes put together  I do wish that  of the individual DVD covers had the same pictures as  Japanese Cinar Oz videos I saw in the landvanoz fan site as well as having Englsih subtitles  BUT I do have the original TV Show and thats all that matters    although having

murders identify perpetrators BEFORE they commit the crime The skill the police have to use is to identify the locations and people in the visions and get there before the crime takes place whereupon the would be perp is promptly arrested and incarcerated for the crime they havent yet had time to completeThe program based only in Washington has become popular enough to go National Outside political forces are taking an interest and looking for flaws in the systemLead PreCrime cop John Anderton Tom Cruise is your typical troubled cop he lives in a messy apartment has certain habits that would curtail his pension and has major family issues He is estranged from his wife his son disappeared some six years earlier His superiors are after his badge Whilst reviewing the latest mureder visions his life takes a more complicated turn when they show John Anderton himself committing the murderHe hears of Minority Reports precog visions that could contradict the ones for which he is being pursued To get to it and the truth Anderton must break into his old workplaceAnderton has to escape arrest by his colleagues and like many a hapless fugitive before him clear his nameSpielberg

beauty like another Philip K Dick project Total Recall the minutae of life in  is happily paraded before us generally in a very subtle manner Product placement is another matter and we are belaboured with it but somehow it has a believable absurdity the joke is on the advertiser as billboards identify you by retinal scan and begin to pitch to you personally This could well be the future of America and dont be too smug UK youre going that way tooThe action scenes are eye popping with jet pack powered police units whizzing merrily in pursuit of escapees dangling from gravity defying vehicles on vertical interstatesThe plot Well youve seen it before as The Fugitive but the end game defies ones expectations in some delightfully twisty ways Those cop cliches are used to the benefit of the plot although I think the villain is exactly who youd expect it to be from the outset despite those herrings that are red in colourAnother bonus this is a surprisingly funny film from Spielberg with a sense of humour reminiscent of Total Recall and Fifth Element Peter Stormare relishes every second as a snotty back street eyeball identity fraudster that crosses paths with Cruise in one squirm inducing sequence Dubliner Colin Farrell earns the acting plaudits as the cop after Andertons badge and a brief eye catching turn by Lois Smith as a deranged geneticist Alas everyone else is just

A2V3P1XE33NYC3,630196697X,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 5]",After watching Sam Fullers  classic The Naked Kiss I cast my eyes in the direction of another of his memorable films No it wasnt Shock Corridor although I plan on watching that one in the next few months I decided to go with his  picture Pickup on South Street for a number of reasons One Fuller cast Richard Widmark in the lead role Im familiar with this actor thanks to many of his later films Irwin Allens schlock masterpiece The Swarm among them and I wanted to see what he could do in the earlier phases of his career Two I liked the idea of watching a film dealing with communism in the United States during the s With the Red Scare and McCarthyism in full bloom I wanted to see how Fuller would fashion a film describing the governments methods for tracking down the reds Three and finally an online friend who initially turned me on to Fuller had nothing but great praise for Pickup on South Street Her extensive knowledge of foreign films coupled with as good an eye for older American films left me feeling confident that this Fuller movie would be an entertaining experiencePickup on South Street begins with an irresistible hook that draws the viewer into the film A pickpocket on a train in New York City lifts the contents of an attractive womans purse while a couple of tough looking men pay close attention to what is going on Why are these two men so interested in what the criminal is doing Are they citizens Police officers Or are they far more sinister figures Right from the start Fuller has us asking questions that we hope will find resolution later on Skip McCoy Richard Widmark the criminal committing the crime just walked out of prison after serving a few years for picking pockets His latest crime is about to plunge him into a situation that could well result in a much much longer sentence The woman he robbed Candy Jean Peters is actually a messenger for a guy named Joey Richard Kiley She carries items that he wants transported to various individuals around town but she pays more attention to the money he gives her than the item in question Bad mistake It turns out that Joey is a communist stooge and spy for the Soviet Union Candy carried in her purse a piece of microfilm containing important American secrets and Skip walked right into the middle of the ongoing investigation to break up the spy cell Now hes in the middle of the feds the police and the communists all of whom want that microfilmThe guys on the train dont know the name of the pickpocket so they go to the local police station hoping the criminal has a record The cops bring in Moe Thelma Ritter a stool pigeon of some renown in the city to help identify and track down the perpetrator After a hilarious scene in which Moe negotiates a price for her assistance she helps the authorities identify and track down Skip He lives on the river in a decrepit little shack keeps his beer cold by dunking it in the water at the end of a rope and has no interest whatsoever in helping the authorities Why should he These are the same guys who sent him to the stir and hell go back there for some serious time if he admits he lifted Candys purse Appeals to McCoy on a patriotic level fail spectacularly hes the sort of guy whose loyalty revolves around money and his few friends Meanwhile Joey is going ballistic Hes facing arrest by the government on one side and the decidedly unfriendly communists on the other He sends Candy out to track down Skip and retrieve the microfilm which backfires when the two strike up a grudging respect for one another As Joeys desperation ratchets up it soon becomes obvious he will resort to anything including murder to reclaim the microfilmThere is no reason to spoil the conclusion except to say it isnt a surprise considering the climate of the country in the early s Its how Fuller gets us there that works wonders Not a single character in this film is anything less than totally believable surely a credit to the standout actors involved in the production Widmark is a joy to watch as he smirks and wisecracks his way through an extremely dangerous situation Kileys sweaty mug and singleminded ruthlessness more than adequately portray a man desperately trying to avoid doom As for Jean Peters she plays clueless eye candy as good as any other actress around But its Thelma Ritter who steals every scene shes in as the indomitable Moe Shes an elderly woman nearing the end of her days who wants nothing more than to save up enough money to buy a plot in a highclass cemetery Moe is also an extraordinarily colorful and humorous character selling cheap ties whenever she isnt ratting to the cops Despite her complicity with the police no one hates her Even Skip responds with Moes gotta eat too after being told the woman ratted him out Her fate marks the highpoint of Pickup on South StreetCriterions DVD version of the film contains all the extras left off The Naked Kiss disc Tons of Fuller film trailers interviews with the man himself stills and posters and recollections from Widmark provide information about the movie While I dont buy Fullers

Stalker is certainly an oddity Released in  loosely based on the short novel Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky and directed by Tarkovsky the masterful Russian director who lived too short a life it tells the tale of a part of Russia that has been visited by an odd event It may have been a meteorite that fell or it may have been an alien visitation But the event created the Zone a dangerous area which was cordoned off by the police and where few could goA Stalker  a sort of guide who takes people through the traps in the Zone  meets up with two men who want to visit the Room a place where wishes come true One is a Professor a man of reason and the other a writer a man of inspiration The Stalker is a man of belief Very little happens in the movie which lasts more than   hours except for their trip to the Room and their discovery of what they want from itStalker is science fiction only in its premise there are no aliens no magic nothing that would be noticed as science fiction It is a slow movie very little happens and some of the shots are several minutes long Its a science fiction movie as it would have been written by Samuel Beckett Yet its a brilliant existential examination of the desires of men and womenAt first the film begins in sepiatoned blackandwhite but once the three characters reach the Zone the film changes to color Just as Oz was in color so was the Zone The Zone is located outside an industrialized city and is full of the detritus of modernity Yet Tarkovsky films these banal castoff items with the plastic beauty that he showed in all his films Some of the shots are breathtakingly haunting yet there is nothing special in themIn a prescient shot near the end of the movie the Stalker can be seen returning to his home with his wife and daughter and across the river a nuclear power plant is seen The Zone could be the area surrounding Chernobyl There is no devastation simply signs of nature taking over some human artefactsAccording to an interview with the production designer the film took two years to shoot The first years footage was lost apparently because it was an experimental film stock that couldnt be developed Though that suggests that it was only sent for development after the entire film was shot which seems at odds with the way movies were created at the time Tarkovsky then started over reshooting the entire movie over another yearThe DVD is decently produced though the English subtitles are a bit clunky It contains the original mono soundtrack and also a recent  mix which in my opinion ruins the movie It is merely the mono soundtrack with added environmental sounds trying to create atmosphere yet Tarkovsky used a lot of silence in this film and the surround mix is never quietI first saw Stalker in the early s at a retrospective of movies by Wim Wenders in New York Wenders had made a selection of films to be shown with his movies and preceding his Kings of the Road In the Course of Time was Stalker and John Fords The Searchers All three of these movies are quests searches for people or ideas and the very long program that day more than  hours was an extraordinary example of three different approaches to the quest movie Since then it has been one of my favorite films Its an odd movie more like a Beckett play than science fiction yet it is unforgettableIf youve never seen Stalker you should by all means watch it It is a truly unforgettable movie by one of the great directors of the th century His life and career were too short but his films are all

A17639YIJLDS1G,B00HUCF420,still searching,"[10, 11]",Being a fan of both gothic literature and crime fiction and a huge admirer of Tim Willocks and James Lee Burkes novels principally featuring the latters New Iberia detective Dave Robicheaux and his sidekick Clete Purcell I eagerly awaited the appearance of HBOs True Detective Basically its a buddy movie or more accurately a buddy anthology since both its protagonists spectacularly brought to life in this first installment by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson play homicide cops for the Louisiana State PoliceOf course since detectives work in pairs its hard not to make a buddy movie about cops one notable recent exception being Prisoners featuring Jake Gyllenhaals billy nomates From Bodie and Doyle Starsky and Hutch and Cagney and Lacey right up to the recent crop of Nordic Noir imports The Killing and The Bridge the crime element almost always takes backstage slightly to the developing relationship between the cops True Detective is no exception and it is the character arc of predominantly Woody Harrelsons Detective Marty Hart which provides the interest here both cops are damaged or at least troubled lost souls more obviously so in the case of McConaughys Rust Cohle whose eccentricities are explained by the fact that hes from Texas So it is that at first Detective Hart appears to be the wellbalanced sane feet on the ground type of guy assigned a new slightly strange partner from out of state  However initially at least this relationship is definitely of the love hate variety with the love conspicuous by its absenceTheyre sent to the scene of what appears to be a ritual killing and so begins the investigation of the murder of the unfortunate former prostitute Dora Kelly Lange And gradually as the investigation develops we get the impression that all is not right in Martys life and just as there is a very dark undercurrent flowing beneath the seeming respectability of the civic life of Vermilion Parish and the wider state scene of Louisiana so there are features of Martys domestic and professional situations that dont bear too close a scrutiny And progressively we begin to detect that the apparently most troubled of the two Cohle is in fact the one whose integrity remains intact as his partner slowly disintegrates under the pressure of being forced to confront both the unsavoury reality of his working life and the values upon which his domestic relationships are founded and the conflict within his soul becomes a raging war between the two sides of his personalityDualityduplicity is a constant thread running through the story from for example Cohles four years spent as an undercover narcotics cop among an East Texas biker gang and Harts reprehensible antics to those of the odious Rev Billy Lee Tuttle and his family Even Maggie Harts unfortunate wife a victim of his extracurricular activities decides to use his own methods against him defiling herself and Cohle in the process Added to this is the destabilizing effect on Hart of his oldest daughters emerging sexuality signaling her eventual departure from the family home representing once again a breakdown of the family as a unifying principle in his life Thus when she is caught in the back of a car with not one but  two teenaged boys his instinctive reaction is to hit out  with unthinking violence because in doing so he somehow manages to assuage his own guilt at consorting with much younger women and reestablish the norms of his socialdomestic order This partly explains the extremes of Harts violence whenever hes confronted by his own indescretions it is Cohle who holds up to him a mirror from which he cant avert his gaze and which therefore must be smashed into nonexistenceAnother main character of course is the mysterious perpetrator heard about but rarely seen and referred to variously as the Green Spaghetti Monster and the Yellow King who inhabits Carcosa which seems to be in the latter case a direct reference to the late Nineteenth Century writers of Lovecraftian type supernatural tales Robert W Chambers and Ambrose Bierce respectively Check out the cover art from the recent CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform edition of Chambers The King in Yellow to see what I meanBut perhaps the most mysterious character of all is the Louisiana countryside an often bleak flat seemingly neverending terrain of impenetrable bayous swampy inlets baldcypresses and oak forests a terrain that gives shelter to the monster towards which the action propels our two driven detectives who in seeking to end its nefarious reign look to salvage some kind of personal and joint redemptionThe whole thing is brilliantly realized the writing assured the narrative multilayered the plot complex the dialogue rich and authentic and the acting stunning Weve been spoilt by  Homeland The Killing and The Bridge etc but this is right up there with the very best and the icing on this particular cake is the theme song by the Handsome Family that effortlessly evokes the alien nature of the angelabandoned country through which with Cohle and Hart we fearfully treadAnd we hear its echoes still  lingering in our dreams,5,From Gothic to Grand Guignol!,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",fan gothic literature crime fiction huge admirer

Hartley,"[1, 1]",Humorist Matt Groening once observed Sex is funny The French are a funny people Then why is it that no French sex comedies are funny On the other hand you have Roger Ebert who once lamented about a trend in which Hollywood buys French comedies and experiments on them to see if they can be made into English with all the humor taken out I generally concur with both those sentiments but I think I have found the exception to Groenings and Eberts rules in the guise of a smart funny and warm French comedy Mon Meilleur Ami which I thought was one of the better films of  that has inspired an equally smart funny and warm American remakePaul Rudd stars as Peter Klaven a somewhat selfeffacing yet amiably goodnatured Los Angeles real estate agent who has decided to pop the question to his ladylove Zooey Rashida Jones The bubbly Zooey immediately begins enthusiastically phoning up a bevy of close girlfriends to share the happy news When she asks her new fianceacute why he isnt jumping right on the horn to tell all his pals as well he mumbles some vague excuse and appears eager to change the subject It turns out that while Peter is adept at meeting women he is more diffident when it comes to interacting with other guys he cant readily name anyone who qualifies as a bro nor can he seem to cough up a candidate to be Best Man at their wedding Someone is going to have to come up with an Action PlanDesperate to find himself a good bud on such short notice Peter seeks assistance from his gay brother SNLs Andy Samberg who happily sets him up on some man dates Zooey pitches in as well helpfully brokering a poker night invite for Peter from her best friends reluctant husband a skulking Jon Favreau hilariously effective here playing a supreme jerk Most of these intros and invites end in embarrassment andor some form of social disaster Just when all seems lost a Dude ex Machina arrives in the form of a freespirited man child named Sydney Fife Jason Segel Teach me to dance ZorbaIn its best moments and this is high praise I was reminded of Barry Levinsons Diner which I consider the granddaddy of all modern bromantic comedies as well as one of the most keenly perceptive observations about male friendship ever put on screen I think its interesting to note that screenwriter Larry Levin who coscripted with director John Hamburg also wrote a classic part Seinfeld episode called The Boyfriend in which Jerry develops a man crush on one of the NY Mets this film could be seen as an extrapolation on that theme In its worst moments the film threatens to lean on that tiresome crutch of cheap grossout humor that has largely put me off of contemporary comedies but thankfully the reins are judiciously pulled in Woody Allen has managed to make tons of funny films over a  year period without one scene involving projectile vomitingso why cant the current crop of comedy directors learn from thisRudd and Segel play off each other extremely well and are obviously developing a solid comedy duo franchise Rudd continues to perfect an onscreen persona as the quintessential postmodern comic Everyman I thought Segels performance strongly

A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B001VG2MEO,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 2]",Ive seen a pretty fair chunk of JeanLuc Godards s output but there are still quite a few to go mostly because back when I was seriously going through his stuff there were many that werent available including the stillunseen LA CHINOISE LES CARABINIERS and this film which comes chronologically between the much better known BANDE agrave PART and ALPHAVILLE  It just showed up on R DVD a few months ago to apparently little interest if the couple of reviews here are any indicationI have to say after seeing it Im at a loss to see why the film has so much less renown than most of JLGs other work from the period unless its that it just isnt very funny  This is a very serious work and perhaps Godards most accomplished feminist I use that word advisedly in regard to this director film from his early period  Sure hed dealt with women as protagonists and in terms of their placement in society in VIVRE SA VIE and UNE FEMME EST UNE FEMME but both of those films are closer to fantasy and dealing with issues like prostitution strip tease etc  and starring Godards muse of the time Anna Karina they read uncomfortably like male fantasy however much Godard was on some level pretending to say something serious about the womens issuesNot so this film which contrasts the two lives of Charlotte Macha Meacuteril  with her lover Robert a musician Bernard Nol and her pilot husband Pierre Philippe Leroy with whom she has an adopted son from his first marriage  It opens with a love scene between Charlotte and Robert but not surprisingly a pretty unconventional one showing hands feet closeups of eyes and noses etc  everything eventually except for the naughty bits  Of course one couldnt go very far in  even in France but the filming of isolated features has a formal aspect to it that extends throughout the film as we are shown repeated fragmentary words a Godard specialty of course but in this case the words and phrases come from magazines bits of speechthoughts isolated from the main action and eventually repetitions of the same kind of love scene with Pierre as the lover this time  though its a much shorter scene  The music  mostly Beethovens th string quartet  also lends a fragmentary quality to the proceedings though the mostly static or very slowlytracked long shots courtesy of Godards usual cinematographer Raoul Coutard at his best here with a spectacular sequence that shifts back and forth between negative and positive images belie this techniqueMuch of the film then works in a distancing isolating way there are regular film references song references but they are almost always very brief whisperstheres a repeated motif about history also and its importance or the regularity with which its forgotten most notably centered around the Holocaust  which climaxes in Charlotte and Pierre going to see a movie at the airport cinema can you imagine And its got curtains and everything that they think is going to be a Hitchcock film but instead ends up being Alain Resnais NUIT ET BROUILLARD  They leave after a minute or two  There seems to be an underlying notion throughout that those who want to take an intellectual view on things often do for reasons that alienate and keep them apart from others  that in fact help to contribute to an antiintellectualism and a deliberate shallowness that Godard sees as a very powerful thing even in  Paris  The reasoning that Pierre and Charlotte give to a guest for living in the suburbs is a wonderful bit of rationalizing their bourgeois character for exampleAnd the flipside of all the intellectual and philosophical talk is Charlotte absorbed in beauty and fashion and love and men  but also more honest and at the end more selfaware and willing to look outside of herself in life than either of the two men  Its to the credit both of Godard and of Meacuterils spectacular performance that we can have such conflicted views of her at the end  admire her strength of character ultimately and her growing understanding of the situation shes in but also wonder how we are meant to take her shallow feminine character  Shes certainly much more likeable and probably smarter than either of the two men shes involved with  but are we to take it that superficiality is preferable to pretension  The film is never clear but it opens up so many possible answers and further questions that I was left fairly mentally drained  And thats a good thingI certainly wouldnt recommend this to those who dont like Godards style in the first place and its not very conventionally entertaining but I was definitely enthralled  Pretty close to a masterpiece certainly as deserving as most other early Godard of being remembered and discussed and I look forward to getting back to this master again before long,5,Obscure Godard should be much better known,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",pretty fair chunk s output still quite few go mostly seriously stuff many werent

A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUSLO,FNDNreview,"[1, 2]",Mr Peabody and Sherman are beloved cartoon characters similar to other onscreen duos including Yogi Bear and Boo Boo Gumby and Pokey or Rocky and Bullwinkle  Speaking of Rocky and Bullwinkle Mr Peabody and Sherman debuted and starred in their own segment on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show beginning in the s  featured prominently in a segment called Peabodys Improbable History  The fatherson pairing would famously travel through time interacting with some of the worlds most famous individuals such as Leonardo da Vinci Jackie Robinson and Edgar Allan Poe  And while the time traveling duo hasnt exactly been completely irrelevant in the modern era of animation  the characters have been in desperate need of a facelift for quite some time which they adequately receive in their new DreamWorks feature Mr Peabody and ShermanDirected by Rob Minkoff The Lion King The Haunted Mansion Mr Peabody and Sherman features the voices of Ty Burrell as Mr Peabody a ridiculously smart and accomplished dog that is the adoptive father of a sevenyearold boy Sherman Max Charles  Using his offthechart intellect Mr Peabody has constructed a time machine called the WABAC in order to travel to past points in time to interact with some of historys most important figures  in casual fun manner that doesnt disrupt timeEventually Sherman must return to school but when one of his classmates  an intellectually outmatched and jealous girl Penny Peterson Ariel Winter begins bullying him an incident forces the school principal to contact a Child Services agent Mrs Grunion Allison Janney  The sour by the book agent informs Mr Peabody that she will be visiting their home to determine whether or not she should remove Sherman from his care  This news prompts Mr Peabody to invite Penny and her parents Paul Stephen Colbert and Patty Leslie Mann over for dinner to rectify the situationOnce the Petersons arrive Sherman is forced to spend time with Penny  at which point he divulges that Mr Peabody has constructed a time machine  Naturally she wants to see it and together Penny and Sherman wind up taking a time through time that quickly garners the attention of Mr Peabody and leading to all sorts of high jinks as the trio bounce from point to point throughout the pastSurprisingly Mr Peabody and Sherman is a film that both kids and adults can easily enjoy  This particular animated feature similar to The LEGO Movie presents a rather elaborate and supremely thorough plot  This story not only incorporates a wide range of open adventure and imagination but it also integrates a great deal of history and historical figures within the spontaneous escapades  As far as time travel animated flick goes its hard to image anyone being able to top the limitless boundaries that this particular story conceivesWhile the action and adventure steal quite a bit of screen time the importance of the themedriven relationship between Mr Peabody and Sherman also takes center stage  Initially these two individuals are present as more of characters bound by a friendship instead of a parentchild dynamic  Sherman unmistakably cares for Mr Peabody who refuses to be referred to as dad or father yet is also coping with the idea of having a dog as a parent  Sherman is positively presented as a nerd but at the same time he wants to fit in amongst his classmates  which proves to be difficult because he is so much smarter than everyone else  Enter Penny a girl who also wants to be the smartest person in the room  However her relationship with Sherman becomes just as important as the fatherson connection with Mr PeabodyNot only are the characters and plot satisfying but the quality of the animation is as well  Mr Peabody and Sherman provides such appeal to the eyes that its a shame it took so unbelievably long for this film to make it through production  Even though this feature does pop at you something tugs at my thoughts forcing me to contemplate that Mr Peabody and Sherman should have never been put on the big screen and remained strictly as a television series  Why  Historical interaction of this nature would be better suited for kids on a regular basis and not every five or six years when a production company manages to get all of their ducks in a rowOverall Mr Peabody and Sherman will make for great fun full of spontaneity and adventure  Still there are subtle differences between these characters and the characters from the original television cartoon  The relationship between Sherman and Mr Peabody is far more loving and caring while their trips through time are far less scatterbrained and well  crazy  Never the less this updated facelift will charm the pants off parents while presenting attractive charismatic characters to the kids  On top of the nonstop adventure theres also plenty of slapstick humor and an occasional pun for the mature audience  The animation is topnotice and this

AYG1U47VFZ165,B005LAIHAY,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 4]",Theres something to be said for never trying too hard  Take Luc Besson for example  Hes been making films for decades but he really hasnt been trying all that hard since THE PROFESSIONAL  And yes I know all about THE FIFTH ELEMENT  Im one of those rare scifi junkies who thought much of the movie was garbage  At the time of its release I believe Luc Besson was all over the place in interviews bragging about how he wrote the script for THE FIFTH ELEMENT when he was in high school  Well for the record let me say that I thought THE FIFTH ELEMENT felt like a picture someone in high school had written and I stand by thatIn any event lets get to LOCKOUT Theres no doubt in my mind that Luc threw this together after more than a few viewings of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK which studios have threatened for the last decade or so to reboot but thankfully no one has made that mistake a reality  Guy Pearce stars as Snake Plissken  oh no  Hold up there partner  Guy Pearces name in LOCKOUT is Marian Snow  Snake Plissken  or should I say the incomparable Snake Plissken  was played by the equally incomparable Kurt Russell with direction from John Carpenter no less  Guy Pearce is a good actor  He does a fine job with what hes given  But he is no Snake Plissken  At best hes a wussified Snake Plissken quick with the quips and the snarks whereas Snake wouldve used a club with spikes in the end of itIn any event lets get back to LOCKOUT Emily Warnock played by Maggie Grace is the Presidents daughter and she decides to take it upon herself to visit Americas first prisoninspace for the purposes of guaranteeing that the inmates are being treated humanely  Rumor has it that the cryogenic freezing process is somehow damaging prisoners brains once theyre thawed out for release  As luck would have it her visit just happens to coincide with a breakout orchestrated by Alex Vincent Regan and his wickedly insane brother Hydell Joseph Gilgun  What are the prisoners hoping to accomplish  Well were never really told but before you can say spit theyve released all of the prisoners  Though theyre contained to certain regions of the station apparently the designers thought it was a good idea to keep the important controls in areas sealed up with the inmatesThats just the first of many plotholes and questionably gaps in logic presented in this B movie masquerading as an Amovie  Second why is it that the stations orbital defense weapons never fire on shuttlecraft but will regularly fire on any other type of approaching spaceship  Third why is that once the prisoners break free they just hang around in the same spot chatting with one another  Fourth  well I think you get the point And its a shame really  So much of LOCKOUT actually looks very solid  The effects are impressive  not perfect but expensive theatrical shots clearly  If theres one significant downside to the prevalence of CGI in motion pictures then it would have to

A3NQU1649SH0Q4,630243954X,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[1, 1]",WERE NOT MARRIED is a  Twentieth CenturyFox blackandwhite comedy about five couples who find they were not legally married due to a foulup two and a half years earlier on the part of a bumbling Justice of the Peace played by perennial cinematic screwup Victor Moore  The most elaborate sequence the first involves radio comic Fred Allen and Ginger Rogers who host a popular am radio show called Breakfast With the Glad Gladwyns a very broad satire of breakfast with programs popular at the time most notably Breakfast With Dorothy Kilgallen the columnist and Dick Kollmar her actor husband  Unlike the real thing the Gladwyns lovefest is a gaffe all the way the couple actually hate each other and breakfast takes place inside a broadcasting studio with stunt people on hand to mimic the sounds of pouring coffee a small child and a singing canary  The fun of this sequence lies in its utter cynicism toward marriage celebrity and the ethics of a radio show that constantly plugs products as though such chatter were a part of normal breakfast conversation  Offmike Ginger Rogers character refers to a sponsoring brand of coffee as laundry juice and the other products are just as cockeyed  Few actors played sarcasm as well as Ginger Rogers but in Fred Allen she may have found her matchThe second sequence  and shortest in the movie  stars Marilyn Monroe as a contestant for the Mrs Mississippi beautyqueen title and David Wayne as her spouse who stays home with the baby while she is away  The fatal letter announcing that their marriage was a nonevent comes while she is off on a publicity tour  The two play off each other very well but the sequence may draw outrage from those who were misled by the deliberately misleading DVD cover box which makes the movie appear to be Marilyns affair entirely  In reality Monroe is billed fourth in the movie and she appears onscreen for less than ten minutes  The third sequence stars Eve Arden and Paul Douglas as a couple who married out of New Yorks Cafeacute Society whirl then moved to Manhasset Long Island where things got dull very quickly  The chief event one evening is the arrival of the latest BookoftheMonth  The fourth sequence stars Louis Calhern as a Texas oil millionaire who is tricked by his luxuryloving wife Zsa Zsa Gabor into a divorce  The sequence is charming in its own way though somewhat foreordained Calhern and Gabor got the lowest billing in the movie when it was first releasedThe fifth and secondlongest sequence stars Eddie Bracken and Mitzi Gaynor as a soldier and wife  She learns she is pregnant just as he learns that they have no legal marriage as he is enroute to the front and away from her  A bright and fastpaced comedy of errors emerges despite the fact that the script will not let anyone use the words illegitimate or pregnant  Lee Marvin has an uncredited role as Pinky an Army buddy who helps explain the situation to Brackens top Sergeant  To end the movie a very quick montage sequence lets us in on how the various couples resolve the situation  All in all WERE NOT MARRIED is a wellplayed chapter comedy with good performances from stars and supporting players including Jane Darwell as the JPs longsuffering wife and Paul Stewart as a loathsome divorce lawyer  Aside from the consumer fraud of letting purchasers think this is a Marilyn Monroe picture the chief regret here is probably that the story of a sixth couple rural folk played by Walter Brennan and Hope Emerson was cut for length even though the resulting feature runs only  minutes That sequence still exists why wasnt it reincorporated into the DVD release It is also a shame that the DVD has no significant bellsandwhistles

Rating Video Rating D Video Rating Audio Rating Extras Rating Overall Rating s Thor obviously wasnt the first step towards the assembling of The Avengers the groundwork for that had been laid years earlier with Iron Man and to a lesser extent The Incredible Hulk  Thor did however make the premise of The Avengers feel a lot more tangible to moviegoers  The rest as they say is history Thor was followed by Captain American which was then followed by The Avengers  As we wait for The Avengers  the cycle repeats and were treated to individual superhero films again now up Thor The Dark WorldThe God of Thunder Thor must stop the Dark Elves a dangerous and ancient race from obtaining the Aether a substance capable of destroying Asgard Earth and the rest of the universe  With the help of Jane Foster and his treacherous brother Loki Thor puts into action a daring plan to save the universe and banish the Elves foreverMost of the cast of the original Thor returns  The main exception being the minor role of Fandral originally portrayed by Josh Dallas he was replaced by Chucks Zachary Levi  Chris Hemsworth slips back into the role that made him a household name almost effortlessly and continues to be ferocious and charming  Coming as no surprise Tom Hiddleston continues to be a scene stealer despite his character being locked up for most of the filmOther Thor actors namely Idris Elba Stellan Skarsgrd Anthony Hopkins Jamie Alexander and Ray Stevenson put in inspired performances even with their limited screen time Natalie Portmans performance is a little harder to diagnose reportedly she was unhappy when original director Patty Jenkins left the project and was contractually compelled to appear in the film  Perhaps Im reading too much into the reported dispute but I didnt feel she had as much enthusiasm for this project as the originalWhile those appearing in front of the camera mostly stay the same the talent behind the scenes has changed dramatically  Gone are writers Ashley Miller Zack Stentz and Don Wayne and director Kenneth Branagh  The writing staff consists of five writers Christopher Yost Christopher Markus Stephen McFeely Don Payne and Robert Rodat while the directing duties have fallen to Alan Taylor  Mostly known for his TV work Taylor does have experience directing features but its his background on the small screen that sets him up for success as he shows finesse in handling the films more personal momentsFinding the right balance between drama and humor can be a difficult tightrope to walk but for the most part Thor handles it quite well up until the third act  Then at the most inopportune time some issues regarding the films balance and tone start to derail The Dark World and rob it of its sense of urgency and danger  Its not a deal breaking problem but it does hold the film back from having a truly memorable climaxThor The Dark World has been given two Bluray releases a standard D release and a D version which also includes the D version on a separate disc  The D version also includes a digital copyThe D presentation is flawless  Black levels are inky the color palette is vibrant on Asgard especially and flesh tones are natural and lifelike  Detail consistently wows everything from the fine stubble of Thors beard to minute costume textures are clearly visible  I couldnt find a single negative quality to nitpick about the D transfer its simply outstandingThe D version of the film isnt quite as successful as its D counterpart  Brightly lit scenes look fantastic theres little to no crosstalk colors still pop and theres very little drop off in terms of detail  Much of the D effect doesnt always jump out of the screen instead its used to create a greater sense of depth  That may disappoint some viewers but I prefer D to be used like a scalpel and not an ax  The transfer runs into some trouble during the numerous dark or dimly lit scenes  The D effect just doesnt pop as much and you may find yourself struggling more to digest what youre looking at  With that said even at its worst The Dark Worlds D presentation is equal to or better than that of the first Thors D BlurayThere should be no complaints about the well balanced and aggressive DTSHD Master Audio  surround track  Dialogue is always crisp and intelligible the surrounds provide plenty of ambient noise and when needed some appropriate directional effects and Brian Tylers score is well balanced  This is nothing short of what youd expect from one of Marvels signature cinematic propertiesSpecial features range from the mundane to the extraordinary  The signature special feature is the Marvel One Shot All Hail the King fourteen minute long short film starring Ben Kingsley from Iron Man   Its a fun little companion piece that gives a little insight to one of the most intriguing side characters of the Marvel universe  Youll also find a commentary with director Alan Taylor cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and actor Tom Hiddleston the track is a bit dry but is informative  The thirtytwo minute long documentary A Brothers Journey Thor  Loki explores the casting performances stories and relationship between the hero and villain  Wrapping things up is a some short featurette about the Brian Tylers score eight minutes of deleted or extended scenes a first look at Captain America The Winter Soldier and a short gag reel  Most of the extras are merely okay but the All Hail the King short improves the whole packageThe greatest thing that can be said about Thor The Dark World is that it doesnt suffer from sequelitis like so many other sequels in recent years  By avoiding the same fate of other recent sequels like Iron Man  and Star Trek Into Darkness this film sets up the Thor franchise for continued success and keeps the Marvel movie machine moving full speed ahead  The D  D transfers are top notch as is the DTS audio track that in addition to the above average special features makes Thor The Dark World an easy to recommend Bluray,4,"Thor: The Dark World 3D Blu-ray Review - ""It doesn't suffer from &#8220;sequelitis&#8221;""",1398556800,"04 27, 2014",Year s

ABE8YHLYSM15G,6305438137,Luke Killion,"[2, 2]",The Thin Red Line is one of my all time favorite movies Even though it is emblematic of what fighting was like in the Pacific its themes say a lot about life and mortality The idea if transcendence is very important in understanding the main character of Pvt Witt played by Jim Caveziel Witt bookends the story as it begins with him and as well as concludes The spiritual aspect is one of the driving messages brought home by director Terrence Malick who also wrote the screenplay based upon the James Jones novelFor most war movies this would not be easy to pull off as realistic depictions of battle rarely impart good feelings to the viewer Malick strikes a perfect balance between realism and a higher motif regarding the inner life of combat soldiers In the wrong hands this could come off as derived or sappy but Malick is definitely a master film maker This picture was the first movie he had made in  years since his pair of Seventies hits Badlands and Days of HeavenLike all good war stories this is an ensemble performance The better non fiction accounts of war usually  contain a good sense of teamwork and unit cohesion The different personalities that make up this film push and pull within the actions of Charlie company during the later stages of the battle for Guadalcanal Jones who was a veteran of Guadalcanal based his novel on the battles around the Matanikau River hill complexes in January of  Even though the Marines are given credit for winning the battle with their defense of the Henderson Airfield perimeter two Army division the rd and Jones th mounted the first successful offensive of the Pacific war on the ground with the combat depicted in this film Up to that point the actions on Guadalcanal had been primarily defensive for the MarinesThe cinematography created by Malick perhaps allowed this movie to be so realistic He shot some scenes on the actual battlefield at Guadalcanal but the main combat segment depicting the Hill  fight was done in Australia The towering vistas and lush tropical environment allow the viewer to really see the conditions that made the Pacific such a difficult war One of the aspects that makes this film so good is the emblematic nature of the fighting Even though it is meant to portray Guadalcanal the combat could be found in almost any island the Army fought in during the war from the Solomons New Guinea the Mariannas to the PhilippinesThe only other film about the war against Japan that compares is Spielberg and Hanks recent HBO Mini Series The Pacific There are many similarities but one is about the Marines the other the Army The Marine campaigns were much more about beachheads while the Army did most of its fighting inland against Japanese bunker complexes The Marines obviously had similar fights up in the hills but this film when compared to The Pacific is great study in the subtle differences between the two branches As witnessed here the Marines secured the beachheads and the Army were brought in as reinforcements once the fight moved off the shoreline According to Floyd Radike who fought with the th Division on Guadalcanal the other principal difference was the approach to clearing tough Japanese defenses The Marines favored a head long aggressive assault style while the Army used more artillery and recon based flanking moves The interplay between Nolte and Koteas is the perfect example of how these schools of thought converged Nolte is West Pointer but he clearly favors the Marine style of attackAnother difference is the structure of command of the Army shown here by Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas Nolte plays an overly ambitious Pattonesque Colonel while Koteas is the cautious and compassionate National Guard Captain who commands C company Their interactions says a lot about the ups and downs of fighting for a institution such as the US Army I found their scenes are some of the most realistic commentaries about the Pacific Army but they do not take up the majority of screen time In fact Malick does a masterful job of spreading the story out to cover all the characters created by Jones with equal attention Sean Penn is the cynical Company Sgt who along with Caveziel add some hard lessons about war Dash Mihok Ben Chaplin Arie Verveen Woody Harrelson and John Cusack round out the ensemble with a text book example of how the war was won with close quarter combat against fortified Japanese positions upon the grassy and jungle covered hills  Malick also added an amazing soundtrack complete with Melanesian

""...no longer Maria!""","[2, 3]",The original  release of The Texas chainsaw massacre an independant film shooted on a very low budget with a debutant director and amateur crew young actors from the University of Texas staged on existing locations like an almost documentaryfilm became infamous under the unfear reputation of being considered a BHorror flick gorefest thanks to the inferior more hollywood sequels and the now celebrity horror character one of the most famous slashers in horror films history Leatherface Fact is and this matter dissapointed more than one theres almost no gore in hereI say this because i believe this original Cult classic is more way more than a Leatherfacefor scenario in slashing and torturing teenagers for the fun as one may think after viewing so many versions sequels and remakes of the TCM this is more than a portrait of this Chainsaw wielding human horror show This is major important film for many reasons I can only think of twoOne this was not a supernatural or science fiction horror movie the two most popular subgenres in horror film industry at the time This film was based in the  career of Ed Gein the reallife serial killer of Wisconsin a character in wich Alfred Hitchcock based his influential masterpiece Psycho I could mention many previous important slasher films in the early s like Italian filmaker Mario Bavas Bay of Blood but this film was something nobody ever imagined could be possible From the initial narration cemetery digging scene to the final excrutiating climax this film is pure fear fear that reflects on ourselves and gets under our skin Forever A monster is not necesearly a mutant or an alien anymore no moreTwo the macabre tense disturbing gruesome atmospheric menacing scenarios and situations the creepy suspense the fear This movie is an actual surrealistic nightmare Some scenes are unbearable because of the atmosphere director Tobe Hooper created product of the almost accidental mix of the low budget and improvisation in the amateurish performances of the drama student actors Because of that important factor the low budget Tobe Hopper had to descent and describe the lowest levels in human psychology and madness the most cheap but difficult work to show on film and succeded in a way never sawn before by leaving most of the gruesome action to our imagination Even the original haunting music score is an important achievement for this film turning the atmosphere unbreathable So here what we have is the story of five teenagers in a van trip that ended up being victims by a family of homicidal slaughterhouse cannibal workers Happy endings No victim can be saved even if they surviveBecause this was the movie that teached me that the most bizarre and cruel behaviors are whithin human kind I used to think as a kid that horror lies in vampires or werewolfs mutants and aliens but it was surrounding me all along in real life And that scared me knowing that the most creepy and disturbing situations one can possibly imagine are recorded on Police Files not in the Nostromos or other fantastic scenarios That i think was the most important contribution of this film in my nowinsecure frightful person Not because of the slasher concept long done and studied before but the way to turn a simple everyday situation into the most realistic horrific atmosphere i have ever witness on filmOk now this DVD edition for this masterful piece of work a brief description and conclusion for you guys High definition transfer from the  mm camera originals English  english  stereo and

different directions as others choices can influence the parties involved in the choice  Moments where choices of others influence involved parties and have a negative effect on the people involved can have devastating affects on individuals  In some instances where the choices of others have negatively affected people it has led to selfdoubt anxiety poor selfesteem depression and suicide  In ixtynin Tum Lalita Panyopas who works in bank finds out that three people are going to be fired  Instead of the regular policy employed here in the western world Tum is pulled into a lottery where the winning sticks get them fired  Tum happens to draw one of these lottery sticksJobless and stranded in her apartment Tum contemplates the different ways she could possibly kill herself as she is aware of her bleak future in a country that is notorious for its heavy level of prostitution No income means that she cannot buy food as she turns desperately to shoplifting  Tum has no savings as she has sent her money home to help support her mother and the future as a bank employee appears to be very rough as many others in other banks have also been laid off  When her thoughts are dark and she sees no possible way of getting out of her situation she finds a small cardboard box outside her doorWhat would you do if you found a box with an obscene amount of money inside  The same thoughts are crossing Tums mind as she calls her best friend for advice  The origin of the money also concerns her but she does not have to wait long until two ruffians from a kick boxing school arrive asking for a box that was outside the door  First they leave but then quickly return to retrieve the money that they suspect Tum has in her possession  During the two thugs search for the money Tum smashes in the head on one of them as he discovered the money that leads to a physical struggle between her and the other thug  Tum gets away shaken and disturbed by the situation as she has killed both of themThe thought of being unemployed has long disappeared at this point for Tum but now she struggles with the idea of going to the police and the guilt she is experiencing  Eventually Tum decides to go to the police but at the police station she sees how they treat criminals in the jail which causes her to change her mind  This means she must find a way to deal with the corpses and maybe other thugs looking for the lost money  As she dwells on her predicament the situation is about to get worse much worseixtynin is an interesting film in many aspects  One of the first and most evident reasons why ixtynin is interesting is because it is from Thailand and visually it brings some of the culture to the story  It also has an appealing affect on the audience as it is a lighthearted comedy with a very dark theme  One question is how could someone make it funny to cut off a male organ and then ground it in order to serve it in a meal  Well ixtynin provides some very bizarre humor which works very well as the timing is right  Yet besides the humor the director PenEk Ratanaruang has succeeded in inserting moral and spiritual elements into the story which also work well  The only thing that seems to be a little too much is the overacting by some of the characters but maybe that is what PenEk Ratanaruang wanted  Despite the overacting in the film ixtynin offers a truly fun and energetic experience with much to ponder,4,Dark Comedy Where Fate Brings Wealth & Death...,1108339200,"02 14, 2005",Fate ultimate tool destiny Yet be different influence choice negative effect have

intertwine murder mysteries and medieval history These stories are wellwritten clever and full of unexpected twists  and theyre filmed with a gritty grimy realistic flavorCadfael finds A Corpse Too Many after a mass execution by King Stephen  theres a strangled corpse slipped in among the executed but the authorities dont seem to care much As he works with the new sheriff Hugh Beringer the canny monk cares for a wounded man uncovers a young monks secret and a love triangle turned deadlyThen Shrewsbury Abbey ends up with a Sanctuary Sparrow when a traveling acrobat is kicked out of the Aurifaber wedding reception unpaid for his work But when the master of the house is found clubbed and robbed a mob chases the young man into the nearest church where he claims sanctuary Now Cadfael must unravel the complex troubles of the Aurifaber household and figure out who there has a motive to killAnd in The Leper of St Giles a young heiress is brought to the abbey to marry the cruel Baron Huon de Domville only of course he ends up dead as a doornail The main suspect is a young squire desperately in love with the girl but of course Cadfael doesnt think he did it  and he needs to figure out whayts going on with the treacherous Picard family before the wrong man is executedFinally Cadfael is shocked when his exfiancee Richildis appears at the abbey along with her nasty husband Gervase

has sadly stopped making  it has all the blood grime and sweat of the th century and accurately depicts the strong presence of religion and politicial strife in medieval lifeFor the most part the writers accurately adapt Peters novels  every mystery has lots of suspects moral dilemmas religious strife civil war a murder that only Cadfael can solve and a bit of cute romance as well And since the series is set long before forensic science was created its fun to see Cadfael scout for tiny clues and patch them together into a caseBut Derek Jacobi is absolutely pitchperfect as Cadfael  his solid performance is kindly wise paternal and a little humorous at times especially as a monk whos seen more of the real world than most of his brothers he was even a ladies man Jacobi does an

A280GY5UVUS2QH,B0016QNSFQ,Doug Anderson,"[6, 7]",There are obvious paralles between Derek Jarman and Ludwig Wittgenstein Both were prodigys and both were homosexuals who struggled to make sense of themselves in a world that either did not acknowledge that homosexual culture existed or vilified it And both were iconoclasts in their respective mediums who were nonetheless obsessed with religious themes and reading their own lives within the context of traditional culture But there the parallels end for temperamentally the two are absolutely incommensurable Wittgenstein is a humorously irreverent child prodigy but a humorless adult Lucky for us Jarman keeps the child version of Ludwig around as a kind of ludic spirit to lighten the gloomy load that is always weighing on the adult Ludwigs joyless mind Cleverly Jarman has everyone except the joyless adult Ludwig wear primary colors and act as if nothing at all weighed on their clever Cambridge mindsThe primary relationships and philosophic pursuits of Ludwigs life are briefly explained and explored The Cambridge set  represented here by philosopher Bertrand Russell gay economist John Maynard Keynes and haughty Bloomsbury socialite Lady Ottoline are drawn to the Viennese genius and enjoy having him around even though he is for all intents and purposes socially dysfunctional In fact this philosopher of language is such a poor communicator that he makes a disasterously poor professor When Bertrand tells Ludwig that his students imitate his behavior it seems ambiguous as to whether Russell means that they mock Wittgensteins  aristocratic and effette mannerisms or affectionately appropriate them Its also not clear if this means that Ludwig has made it fashionable to be gay at Cambridge All of these meanings seem to be suggested but the latter one seems to be the one that Jarman wants to stress without spelling it out this was made for BBC television after all It is clear that Jarman is interested in telling gay history here and as such Ludwig would fit into the gaymanwhocannotaccepthimselfasgayman subject position which is doubly sad since the young Ludwig was so proudly and fearlessly antinormal As a result of this selfloathing all of Ludwigs relationships including his relationship with philosophy are of the lovehate variety Jarman makes it clear that it was his ascetic nature his love of clarity and purity that made him such a groundbreaking philosopher and he also makes it clear that it was this love of purity that made his selfhatred all the more intense But again Jarman keeps things light One never feels the heaviness of the actual life as Wittgenstein himself must have felt it You can judge for yourself whether this is an achievment or an evasionIn addition to the tragic nature of Wittgensteins personal story Jarman is also interested in drawing parallels between the fin de sielce zeitgeist of Ludwigs suicide rampant Vienna and the fin de siecle zeitgeist of his own AIDS rampant London These contextual parallels would probably have been more fully explored had this been a full blown feature film and not simply a onehour made for BBC production As a result this is more like an appetizer than a full meal But given the scarcity of Jarman projects it is savored for what it isIdeally I think Foucault who was as playful as Jarman when it came to dissecting the systems that order us about would have been a better match for this director But its an oddly appealing film nonethelessIronically Wittgenstein is known for enabling us to see language as a game not with a singular set of rules but with as many sets of rules as there are speech communities This breakthrough proved to be liberating for many artists and thinkers Foucault among them who has shed much light on the way discourses shape identity that followed in his wake but Wittgenstein himself tied as he was to the dominant discourse of conventional morality never seemes to have experienced

actors grips your guts throughout the movie making you care about themCAREFUL SPOILERS FROM HERE ONThe story unfolds from the famous or infamous Massacre at Malmedy in the Belgian Ardennes during the German flash counteroffensive in the winter of Four men manage to survive the ordeal keeping a low profile and trying to stay put but not for longWhile seeking the next refuge the four stumble upon a downed British Reconnaissance Pilot who soon joins them out of necessityHe carries important strategic information that has to reach the Allied HQ before the Germans manage to cross the Meuse RiverNot a simple feat since the German lines seem to spread all across where the five are trying to moveNow the mission has switched gears It is not enough anymore to just survive The five have now a true mission at their hands and realize the great responsibility they have been handed out for the future of the Allied advance in the WestNow the five have once again a mission to accomplish A very dangerous one at thatSPOILERS END HEREKnowing the background to which these now five brothers at arms are set we also have their personal stories to deal with The various encounters they have along their way and the different risks and threats always real and always ominously impending on their headsAll this put together in an min movie makes it a classic just like When Trumpets Fade A Christmas Clear or even Band of BrothersConsider only this though This movie was made with a budget below the  million dollar billAmazingBesides what makes it all worthwhile watching is the accuracy in details that one only would expect from a major production and even there only seldom one getsAll this courtesy of passionate WWII reenactors who contributed in droves from all over the United States with accurate vehicle replicas accurate German and US uniforms and firearmsNo more MA HalfTracks standing in for SdKfz s but the real things in working orderThe sound effects also reproduced in DD  Surround Sound are as realistic as one can come No more overdubbed sound effects but the natural actual firearm sounds as they were experienced by those who were thereThe music is simplistic and kept at a respectful level and yet impressive and emotionally charged where neededThe direction of the movie itself is flawless and at times seems to be documentaristic in style as if we the audience were meant to be the sixth member of the groupThere are a few violent scenes but never overdrawn or gratuitous in scope The violence surges out of the events not just for the sake of showing itAnd this alone is done in a very respectful way with the viewer in mind and as such reminds us that those men we are watching are not just heroes they are above all normal everyday guys whose only true ambition is to make it to stay alive long enough as to return safely homeI would recommend it to all and to all ages especially young ones They would probably understand better what being involved in a war is truly all about At least from a pure human point of viewThe DVD is well presented and as said comes with a slick Dolby Digital  Soundtrack as well as having a sharp striking cold picture to it which actually enhances the feeling of the freezing conditions with which soldiers were faced during that campaignIf you already own When Trumpets Fade A Midnight Clear and Band of Brothers this one is a worthy companion to them But in value I would dare say it surpasses them by farI hope that the cast and crew that made this movie might decide to get together one day and show us other

south fanatics but what he really was after was placing blame square on someones shoulders seeing that Morgensterns father had to beg Mel to cut out the blood be on your children part its pretty straightforward as to where he comes from and who he wishes to demonize  Furthermore Gibson is staunchly Roman Catholic demanding that people follow him and keep prayers in the Latin tongueumm alright

 Result we judge not by content of character or work ethic but by idealsProblem  Religious difference as excuse for Racial decimation  The Vatican Mels favorite big brother that old institution in Rome once hellbent on ruling the world how dare these thugs in robes who do little workKarol Wojytola or John Paul II as an exceptionand do absolutely nothing for science or human alleviation but would rather tell women how to live and enjoy old religious ceremonies tell whole nations and unique peoples such as Russia and China how to live has been shown in the last few years child molestation and financial fraudulence to be highly corrupt and hypocritical  How can Rome try to invade England and ruin Germany and deploy Spanish troops to Ireland hundreds of years ago leaving death and destruction in their wake Mel should have thought harder when making Braveheart but being chauvanistic as he is he forgot how the Scottish painted their faces blue and fought off Catholic Roman and Spanish troops trying to invande and take over the British Isles not fight the English who have been a model nation to the world in regards to civilty and scientific thoughtNewton ring a bell anyone  Main Point for a nonspiritual demagoguery such as the Vatican to escape unscathed for what theyve done to so many nations who were gentle and intellgent and progressive all until Catholic dogma invaded theyve really dodged quite a few bullets  However their time is running out  Result a world growing increasingly tired of relgious teachings as their ever evolving senses tell them of its use as a pretext for conquests and plunderingProblem  As the brilliant Harvard professor Samuel Huntington has portrayed in his books on clashes of cultures and remaking world order the world is by no means stable  Not even after civil wars revolutions world wars coupsnone have secured the longlasting peace so hoped for by many but not all eg thugs gangs criminals dictators  the less intelligent reallife monsters of past and present  The world of tommrrow is not one of religion even south america is growing apart thanks to hugo chavezs finger pointing at america but one of national identityironically that has always been the case  Main Point integration and segregation continue to pull at eachother fracturing America more than ever before  The unrealistic thoughts of everyone liking each other and just getting along are over and have never been much more than false words for false security  Result An America and Western world that wakes up to the threats from the east a new China that could be peaceful partner or worst nightmare and countries forced to take extreme measures due to unwanted influences ie muslims taking over Londons streets France becoming a barnyard bash that doesnt work and China wanting to remain a cultural empire unhinged by capitalism  The world will survive and grow as old ideas of how to do just such collapse across the globe  Dogma fails while reason service and a new humanity to all neighbors be they of any race flourishes  The Herculean ManGod ideal fades as people grow tired of God being white black asian green blue etc  The world matures people relax spiritually and scientific advance continues to do some good some bad  As John Lennon so poetically said sometimes we all have to Let It Be,2,Absolute Truths

I had read the back notes and the cover was a man standing mostly naked with blood on his head I should have known better but oh well The movie is a documentory about GG Allin He is best know for being the worst of the worst From Relevieving himself on stage to his claim that he would one day commit suicide on stage The movie open with the narrator telling about the first GG Allin concert he saw Then the movie begins with GG on stage naked slamming himself in the face with his microphone From there it just gets stranger This movie shows GG in all his sick glory You see him on stage and doing what they talked about This man was not hype You see him attack a women at a spoken word show where he is reading from the same Boston paper I first heard about him indo the grossest thing at his birthday party get thrown out of a collage after a show and so many other things that I wont go intoPeople have called this movie funny and smart and what not but I found it more disturbing and sadHowever there are some funny moments in the movie The rest of the cast mokes up for the lack of humor just by being there There is Merill his brother and bass player I put him first becouse dispite his apperance he is the most normal of the group Then there is Dino the naked drummer He is infatuated by an all girl group called The Lunar Chicks He also is whacked out of his skull when they speak with him Then there is Unk That is his name Unk This piece of work is really funny even if it is unintentional He tells about the birthday party asking the director to edit somthing out that he leaves in the final cut how much he loves GG and just make a fool out of himselfGG Allin died in  of a herion overdose Not a surprise becouse when we see him in the movie playing an acustic gutiar and destroying the Warren Zevon song Carmilita he has a needle in the head stockQuite a bit has been made of the fact that GG Allin was the real thing and there was no fake in him Well for that they are right He did not just act nuts he was In a time of Mayilyn Manson we may even see Allin as a breath a freash air but you cant I have seen people bring there kids to Mansons show becouse they know he is a phoney No parent ever brought there kid to see GG AllinGG Allin did not make good on his promise to kill himself on stage but he did do one thing He will forever be known as the best of the worst and whether you think thats a good thing is open to interpritationAfter watching this movie its hard to think about anything else I have never seen a more dispicable person as with GG Allin He is a

interesting person to say the least and in the end he died as he lived Alonecovered in filthand sad His story is not one of great sadness but you do feel sad after seeing it I think its becouse we want very badly to think these people are just hype and some are not GG Allin in the end hated everyone There was only a few people that he allowed even close to him but I think that no one knew him
